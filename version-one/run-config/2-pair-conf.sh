# =================================================================
# Deprecated settings. These settings allow the text to be processed
# using an older processing model. It suffers from various theoretical
# issues having to do with segmentation into words and sentences, and
# thus is not used any more. Segmentation is henceforth handled in the
# in the AtomSpace processing pipeline.
#
# Enable or disable sentence splitting.
# If the text corpora have one sentence per line, then splitting is not
# needed. If the corpora are arranged into paragraphs (as conventional
# for natural language), then the paragraphs must be split into distinct
# sentences.
# export SENTENCE_SPLIT=true

# If splitting is enabled, then specify the splitting language. Choices
# include `en`, `fr`, `pl` and many more; see the splitter directory for more.
# export SPLIT_LANG=en

# Scheme function name for word-pair counting. This is a scheme function
# that will be called to process each sentence.  For example, if the corpus
# contains "Some sentence." then the cogserver will receive
#   (observe-text "Some sentence.")
#
# export OBSERVE="observe-text"

# Enable or disable the application of a transform before text
# submission. See run-common for details.
# export XFORM_SPLIT=false

# Enable observation of text on a line-by-line basis. The file is
# assumed to contain lines of text; each line of text will be submitted,
# one at a time, via the OBSERVE function above.
# export LINE_SPLIT=false
