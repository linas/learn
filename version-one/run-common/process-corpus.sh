# Loop over all of the corpora files (all the files in $CORPORA_DIR),
# and then (optionally) pre-process them and submit them for counting
# by the cogserver. Pre-processing usually means sentence-splitting.
#
# As files are processed, them will be moved from $CORP to the directory
# `submitted` in the current working dir.
#
# Assorted environment variables will be fetched from the <config> file.
# An example config file is in `~/run-config/2-pair-conf.sh`

# XXX TODO Why are we using a config file here? Why aren't we just
# grabbing everything we need from the env?
