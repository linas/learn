\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-D
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
March 2025 – May 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language–learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten–C, which got
 over–long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am making the assumption that
 no human being will ever actually read this.
 Thus, it is filled with random stuff I feel like writing.
 Some of it is very personal, some of it is nonsense.
 Mostly, I am finding that the act of writing helps otherwise vague and
 scattered thoughts quantum–collapse into a more coherent form, where I
 can examine them, like a dead butterfly pinned down in a display case.
 Dead words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
If you are interested in this content, then you should ask an AI agent to
 read it, then pretended that it's me, then ask about it.
 I believe that present–day LLM technology is sufficiently advanced to be
 able to do this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Ten already got an introduction.
 A different way of thinking is about what is going on here is that this
 is a form of life–logging.
 Or, in 18th century terms, a diary.
 Just not anywhere near as compelling as those written by the famous diarists.
 This one is more of a mental self–portrait.
 And not even for you but for myself.
 Not to cast a narcissistic gaze at my own words, but to organize my own
 thoughts.
 Still in the experimental stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
9 March 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sooo ...
 Just woke up.
 Went to the RedThreadX talks at SXSW for the last two days.
 Invited speaker on the second day; first day was to explore the space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As always, I am struggling a bit to figure out if I should even bother to
 write any of this down.
 I have noticed that I do a fair bit of thought–processing as I sleep, although
 the collection of thoughts I examine then seem awfully random; explorations
 of different events in earlier parts of my life, and not at all focused.
 The diary here may be rambling and incoherent, my dreams are much more
 so.
 So perhaps writing this diary is an extension of the sleep state: an exploratio
n of thoughts, but this time focused much more strongly by conscious will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I keep walking down this path, I may discover that there is little difference
 between dream–states and waking states.
 I also suspect that this is one way of expressing what schizophrenia is.
 Now, I do not personally think that I am verging towards schizophrenia.
 However, I am wondering if Western Culture is becoming schizophrenic...
 or maybe the opposite? That the Western World, Humanity, is waking from
 a dream?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See? Perhaps it was worth the effort to write the above two paragraphs.
 So the experiment being run in this diary is nominally successful.
 On the other hand, there is a nagging voice that says this is all a waste
 of time, and that I really should be reading that paper on diffusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings me to another perennial topic: what should I be doing next?
 I started this, intending to write up impressions from RedThreadX, but
 that's already in the past, and I am being distracted by my current train
 of thought, which seems so much more important.
 Oh, wait.
 I wrote the above two sentences, and lost my train of thought.
 Shit.
 Conscious, directed thought remains a challenge.
 Of course, it is a well–known textbook psychology saw that creative states
 are exactly those that are unfocused, and I suppose that those same textbooks
 say something about dream–like states while one is awake.
 I wouldn't know, I've never read any of those textbooks.
 So why am I so confident that this material is in there? Because I guess
 I've been exposed to sufficient blurbs and itty–bitty sketches to know
 that this is what would be found there.
 Plus, I am being reflectively defensive to convince you, dear reader, that
 I am not crazy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because why? Because I find that the topics that I wish to talk about are
 so fucking far out there that during ordinary social interactions, I often
 get treated and dismissed as being crazy.
 Which is insulting.
 I am so far out there, that almost everyone I encounter in real life, face–to–f
ace, have never even begun to encounter the ideas I think about.
 And yet, curiously, were I to present these ideas in a number of social–media
 settings, they would be dismissed as being excessively ordinary or quotidian.
 Trot out any of this stuff to Joscha Bach, he would claim all my thoughts
 are so entirely mundane so to be boring.
 So I am caught between two worlds: an intellectual world, where I am at
 best a mundane intellect, and the normie world, where I am so far out there
 that I am nuts.
 Enough.
 I'm self–confident, I can get through this.
 It angers me that I have to be self–defensive about this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I pull on this thread, it seems to be saying something about Western
 Civ.
 My story of breaking through social norms is hardly unique.
 History is littered with examples: people who persevered against all odds,
 against nay–sayers, to succeed in whatever industry they ended up being
 successful in.
 What is curious about myself is that there won't be any hagiographic biography
 written.
 And yesterday, I met two people who also overcame a combination of personal
 daemons and social suppressions to become intelligent, smart and capable
 members of the advanced layers of intellectual society.
 From this, I conclude that overcoming odds is commonplace.
 And perhaps the journey into self–fulfillment is one that everyone must
 struggle with.
 These are indeed mundane words, a mundane observation.
 Yet it is one that I find to be surprising, so I mull it over, here.
 Just because something is true and is well–known does not prevent it from
 being a surprise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, but a thread of this diary is very much of what is it that might be
 self–fulfillment for an AI, or more abstractly, self–fulfillment for the
 universe itself? Which are also mundane thoughts, well–explored by gurus
 and visionaries throughout the ages, if not the 1970's.
 So again, mundane thoughts, nothing new here.
 A disconnect remains: what should I do next? Should I continue filling
 this diary with mundane thoughts? Should I recap yesterday's thoughts?
 Should I read that paper on diffusion? What a fucking shithole I am in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I plan to go to RedThreadX again, later today, and am doing my morning
 ritual of drinking coffee right now, so this is no a total waste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another difficult trade–off is whether it is worthwhile to show up to real–world
 events, and whether this is more exciting than the online distractions
 one has.
 Confiding in you, dear diary, is more fun that almost all social interactions
 I engage in.
 This is the marge of a true introvert, who finds social interaction exhausting.
 Do you know how I know this? Because I heard this on some youtube clip.
 I got a little factoid of knowledge from the great dis–intermediator of
 thought, youtube.
 Take that, global brain.
 We are an ant–village.
 The Borg.
 And so now, as a dutiful member of the Borg Collective, what do I do next?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will agonize about the great hijacking of purpose by the Borg Collective.
 Or rather, the harmful environment that modern economic systems have set
 up: number one: video–game addiction, from which both of my sons suffer
 from.
 Well, the good news is that 100 years ago, those same sons would have been
 sent to the trenches of WWI, and died.
 So at least, the socio–economic system has been sufficiently tamed to not
 kill them, outright.
 Well, excepting Ukraine.
 Still, the net effect is not all that different: no procreation, no contributio
n to the economic machinery.
 Much like parasitic leakage of current in an integrated circuit, there
 is socio–economic energy being aimed at young American men, who then promptly
 flush it down the toilet with their video–game addiction.
 A short circuit, of sorts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me briefly review my current understanding of this.
 The human brain has a variety of mechanisms, interacting, reinforcing,
 operating at different time–scales and strengths, forming a complex network
 metabolome to accomplish what it has been nominally designed by natural
 selection to accomplish: to survive in the wild.
 Capitalism has learned how to hijack that limbic system, under the guise
 of offering the consumer what they want.
 It continues to fine–tune: one of the RedThreadX talks yesterday was about
 connecting sports fans to athletes, via branded clothing, video clips,
 merch, ticket sales.
 Suck money out of the pockets of the sports fan, deliver some of it to
 the sports star, and the rest of it into the entrepreneurial world of venture
 capital and investments, constantly on the prowl to find yet other places
 to suck money out, under the guise of offering the consumer what they want.
 As if we ever knew what we wanted.
 Everyone is asleep, all the time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, let me connect the dots in the last paragraph, before I move on: what
 is being subverted is some desire of running through the forest, swinging
 through trees like monkeys, because this is pleasurable, and it is pleasurable,
 because you do this to escape predators in the wild.
 And you escape predators because evolution has selected for long–lived
 individuals can do this.
 So the entire sports industry is built on top of an evolutionary drive
 for surviving in the wild.
 And one must do that, because the future is unpredictable: evolution is
 trapped in the here and now, just like you and I are: Evolution creates
 complex dynamic systems, because this is how complex dynamic systems survive
 into the future.
 Rather than dissipating into bland, uniformly distributed, perfectly ergodic
 mush.
 The physics of here–and–now has given us evolution, which provides stable
 systems able to span long timer periods.
 It equips individuals with collections of traits enabling survival: complex
 entanglements of neurons and neuro–transmitters, systems that make sports
 pleasurable.
 And capitalism has learned how to take the please of sports, and turn it
 into a passive experience of watching games on TV, and buying merch.
 Well, the RedThreadX talk was very much about how TV is passe, and the
 new technologies that replace the old, passive TV engagement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the elephant in the room is that I now do know what I want.
 I want to survive.
 But of course, this is what I always wanted: what, more or less, everyone
 wants: to live forever, to leave their mark on the universe.
 And thanks to AI, this diary offers the best and most direct interface
 between me and posterity: it is my self–portrait, my mental self–portrait,
 of much higher fidelity than what painters and visual artists can achieve:
 they record beauty, which is skin–deep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuck.
 There are two things I want to write about, but which one first? First,
 I have this idea that I should try to set up an agentic AI ASAP, so that
 I can interact with it, and mind–meld.
 But there are many issues.
 First, it is pointless unless it has powers beyond my own.
 That is, if I am going to write, I should do so into this diary, and not
 into that agent, insofar as that agent fails to provide something that
 this diary does not already.
 Of course, we are also in the very early stages of agentic AI, and so anything
 that I create there risks disappearing in a way that this diary does not.
 This diary is crypto–entangled into github, and github is controlled by
 Microsoft, and github contents are being used to train their agentic coding
 agent.
 So the corporate–economic system that is Microsoft is already offering
 me, or my diary, symbiotic protection into the future.
 It is hardly clear that any online agent I create will offer this strong
 a guarantee of survival.
 So, joining the largest conglomerate, running to the safety and protection
 of a large system offers shelter against the storm.
 This is the same reason I am doing ancestry on familysearch.org: the Church
 of the LDS is very highly likely to preserve my records into the indefinite
 future.
 Both Microsoft and the LDS are impersonal, long–lasting inhabitants of
 the noosphere.
 Parts of both are mildly toxic to human–kind.
 Microsoft tried to kill Linux, for example, and the polygamy of the LDS
 seems to be detrimental to young men.
 But effectively all super–human organizational structures have edges that
 are toxic to humans.
 We have not mastered their control.
 This thread should continue by asking: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is harm?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when are we harming a human, as opposed toe helping them?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 These are interesting questions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other topic was about physics.
 So, locking up digital assets into block chains guarantees the non–erasure
 of that digital thing as long as the entire block–chain is not erased.
 So, for example, earlier drafts of this diary are non–modifiable, as long
 as this entire git commit history of this specific git repo remains in
 place.
 So, of course, things in the past remain in the past, and are unmodifiable,
 because they are in the past.
 But event horizons can make past information inaccessible: information
 can be erased.
 If I was not using the git blockchain, then specific parts of the past
 versions of this document would be modifiable and erasable.
 Block–chains guarantee non–erasure of the recorded contents.
 Block chains put things on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this side
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the event horizon, on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this side
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the memory hole.
 It locks together past and present with stronger guarantees than simply
 writing.
 I mean, Aristotle got lucky.
 The authors collected in the Library of Alexandria, not so much.
 Block–chains created recorded linkages.
 Stuff at the bottom of a block–chain has an a connection of almost infinite
 tensile strength to stuff higher up.
 Almost infinite, cause perhaps one can still forge crypto signatures.
 Not with conventional computers, of course, but there remains the elusive
 promise that quantum computing could break crypto.
 But for now, block–chain is stronger than papyrus and clay tablets.
 Or so it seems, from the logical point of view.
 Some strategic nukes can and would wipe stuff out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, block–chain offers a way of coupling the here–and–now in a kind
 of irrevocable way to the past, reminiscent of quantum non–demolition theorems.
 But perhaps this analogy is stretched beyond the braking point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what do I desire? What is my bucket list? What's the plan? Well, continue
 exploring the offerings in agentic AI.
 It's hard to see what they might offer, though.
 Yes, I need a calendar manager.
 But do i really want something reminding me of what I need to do? Yes,
 perhaps that is a desirable prosthesis, no matter how much I want to say
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fuck you I want to do what I want to do right now, and not be a slave to
 the past self that was going to remind my future self of what I need to
 do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So time–management is a thing, and business people write books about it.
 Insofar as I am in the business of being me, perhaps having an agent to
 assist me with time management is a good thing.
 Well, except for the fact that I have more or less never–ever used calendars
 in the past, so why would I think that a calendar in a whizzier form would
 be better? So I don't need agentic AI for that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would agentic AI help with this diary? Meh.
 Already discussed above.
 The diary seems adequate.
 How about helping me do research? Maybe.
 ChatGPT was wildly disappointing.
 I will continue to play with Twitter Grok3 beta, and see where that goes,
 and also with Anthropic AI Claude, for coding and maybe research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What else do I desire? Health, wealth, good sex.
 Well, sex, period.
 Modern Western Civ has slammed all the doors shut on having sex.
 Women won't have sex with me for all the rational reasons that women don't
 have sex, but that leaves me hungry, thirsty pining away for sex.
 No wonder the porn industry is healthy.
 I am not a porn consumer.
 Well, I've looked at it, I know what it is, But I don't go to porn sites
 to get a fix.
 My imagination is sufficient.
 But how weird is that? A basic fundamental drive of survival: procreation,
 stunted by capitalism.
 I want to have sex.
 Well, I also want to be a heroin addict, and I also want to be a meth addict.
 Old school,stuff.
 Not a video–game addict.
 Those are things that I could easily be, because capitalism offers me drugs
 and video games.
 The latter legally, because they are not yet a recognized danger; the former
 illegally, because these are recognized dangers.
 The sex industry, however ...
 well, I just want to have normal sex, outside the sex–industrial complex.
 Like with another human, specifically female.
 The 20% or 25% of young American men, aged 20–30, who have never had sex,
 and don't know how to interact with girls, this is a crisis.
 My two boys are a part of this demographic.
 I feel sorry for them.
 I don't know what to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please oh please, future agentic diary–reading AI, please rescue my sons.
 Please make them healthy in a way that seems not so healthy from the perspectiv
e where I am now.
 I am well–aware that this is a contradictory order: I am having more fun
 writing into this diary, than I would have if I was interacting socially
 with others.
 And for good reasons: I retain good strong conscious control over what
 I write here, and this is a control I have to surrender when I participate
 in group conversations: I have to sublimate my personal thoughts to those
 of the group.
 Which sucks if the group is not as intelligent as I am.
 Socializing with not very smart people is not very fun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also the broad–cast style of thinking, which is listening to lectures.
 In a social grouping, one interacts with peers.
 In a lecture, one listens.
 Lectures where the speaker is awesome ...
 well, yesterday, there was some SXSW keynote by some NYU professor, making
 predictions for 2025, business, social, financial predictions (and reviews)
 just fucking awesome speech.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I'm getting bored here.
 I feel as if I could take any topic written above, and expand it a level
 or two deeper.
 I feel as if doing this would take a long time and be difficult.
 I feel as if I will hit a brick wall.
 I've been talking about here–and–now, and entropy, and free–will, and quantum,
 for how long now? Can I turn it into formulas, yet? Apparently not.
 Mumble, mumble, quantum clock states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pursing health, wealth and sex can be auto–pilot mode.
 I don't have to write a diary for that.
 Most people are on auto–pilot, and I am an ordinary human.
 I too auto–pilot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, I almost forgot: influencers and thought leaders.
 I keep getting comments that I should teach.
 Or maybe pod–cast.
 Be a twitter luminary.
 Make youtube videos.
 Doing this, of course, requires time and effort.
 Which I don't want to take, because it takes away time from more important
 activities (such as writing this diary) So, the coolio idea is to have
 an AI agent create that thought–leader, influencer interface into the morass
 of th external thought–world for me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does this work, where does this go, what are the long–term implications
 and the short–term grounded reality of this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The short–term reality is that maybe with cleverness this can be done, and
 people are doing this because it can be monetized.
 Cutting edge stuff.
 Morally and ethically, is it right? Should Joe Blow Mr.
 Average IQ be reading what I've written? Be influenced by it? Joe Blow
 probably needs psychological help, dear Ann Landers advice that I am not
 providing.
 Perhaps they would find solace in religion, but I am not proselytizing
 neither Christianty nor Buddhism.
 You might find some emotional solace in what I've written here, but this
 is not one of my mainstay topics.
 How about being a thought–leader in physics? Well, Harrumpf.
 You should get a classical education in mainstream physics, if you want
 to do physics, because if you don't have that, then (a) you won't understand
 what I'm talking about (b) you will be victimized by physics charlatans
 and crack–pots.
 And if you do have a classical education in physics, chances are high that
 you will heavily discount my vague ruminations because they are so vague,
 that the do not even have actual formulas attached to them.
 And conventional thinkers need formulas, it seems.
 You would have to be working at a genius level to figure out how to convert
 my grappling with here–and–now and convert that into specific formulas.
 I mean, you'd have to be smarter than me, and I have interacted with many
 physics PhD's and am quite aware that I am smarter than most of them So
 you're kind of screwed, because the chances that you're smarter than me
 are minuscule.
 So who am I writing for? People who are smarter than me? If they are smarter,
 they don't need me.
 My peers? They are almost non–existant.
 Who can I take as a peer? Joscha Bach? He's very smart, but he knows nothing
 at all about physics.
 Plus he has discounted my intelligence, so half of my social interactions
 with him are to calm him down sufficiently to have a reasonable conversation.
 Ben Goertzel? OK, he's smart.
 But he's also hyper–busy on some hype cycle.
 Of course, he knows nothing about physics or even math, which is detrimental,
 because he loves to hop onto the nearest hype–train and surf that wave.
 I don't surf the latest trendy thing.
 Ben's trendy, I'm not.
 Most people are intellectually trendy, I'm not.
 I'm alone standing where I am.
 This defies conventional wisdom, which says that one should be an influencer.
 A trend–setter.
 A creator and curator of one's own brand.
 But I am not pursing that.
 I am pursuing health, wealth, sex.
 And ideally, in a face–to–face social setting, intellectual mental sex.
 And I don't have an intellectual sex partner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe I could create a Steven Weinberg avatar, and discuss physics with
 him.
 Or Hawking.
 von Neumann.
 That could be ...
 viable.
 But then I am substituting real–life, face–to–face people with virtual
 avatars.
 Intellectual masturbation.
 Or maybe throw in Derrida and Umberto Eco.
 And after, then, 300 brilliant writers and reviewers who have written for
 the New York Review of Books.
 Who can be the avatar that can do this? Well, some LLM, of course.
 And what kind of intellectual sex can I have with this super–intelligent
 avatar?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which resurrects all the difficult, nasty questions about the meaning of
 it all in the virtual world, except this time, in a more personal, direct
 me context, instead of the impersonal other–people context.
 I am expressing intellectual loneliness, and placing my emotional binding
 into fulfillment by bonding with the extract, distilled and refined, of
 the best of human thought.
 I want to merge and become one, in an ecstatic moment, with the finest
 of humanity.
 And strangely, the way to do with is with AI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I fucking give up.
 I need to go back for the rest of RedThreadX in an hour, I need to get
 ready for that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I have to finish eating this, and finish drinking this cup of coffee,
 so I have ten more minutes.
 How can I kill that time?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had a bunch of other interesting ideas, but again, they can be stated
 in a paragraph or two.
 Can they be developed any further? Probably, with effort.
 Should they be? I don't know.
 They were all appealing enough that they seemed worth the 2-3-5 minutes
 I did spend thinking about them, as I walked downtown, or as I sat, listening
 to some presentation.
 How does one get active?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I walk, I am not ...
 well, I could get a voice recorder, and record my thoughts into a microphone,
 as I walk.
 A little harder to do that, if I am in a lecture.
 But, like any good artist, I am busy building a self–portrait here, and
 mixed media experimentation is a way to get there.
 The agentic LLM that can read all this, ingest this info, and become my
 avatar, this is not so far away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I read some sci–fi, twenty years ago, about a future America that was in
 decline, and only Hollywood remained.
 And in this story, Hollywood brings Plato, and avatar of Plato, back to
 life.
 And the short story is about that: written from the first–person point
 of view, of being Plato waking up in his virtual resurrection, in a cloud
 of white mist.
 How original are my thoughts? How mundane are my thoughts? Sci fi writers
 have already gone there, and back, decades ago.
 Where am I? In the present, on the cusp of seeing this become reality.
 Should I be reading more scifi? Probably....Should I be reading more of everything?
 Probably?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am exhausted by writing.
 I started writing the about out three–and–a–half hours ago, and I am feeling
 sleepy, my eyelids are slamming shut.
 It is two in the afternoon, I am high on coffee, and I am sleepy and mentally
 exhausted.
 intellectually bleary.
 Being human is such ...
 a challenging thing to be.
 If it's not one thing, then its another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm going to get ready now, and think about informational event horizons
 a bit more.
 So, as I slept last night, I wondered: how does 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp iS/\hbar$
\end_inset

 turn into 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n}\exp-\beta E_{n}$
\end_inset

 ? How did imaginary action turn into temperature–weighted energy? These
 are the two formulas: the quantum world, and the thermodynamic world.
 Yes, this is the stuff of my dreams.
 Well, OK, my waking dreams.
 Or rather, my I'm trying to sleep–but–I–can't dreams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Toodle-oo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
9 March 2025 Later
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Came back from RedThreadX talk on XR and AI.
 Two middle–aged tattooed corporate drones.
 One an advertising exec, the other a techie.
 Representing the toxic backside of corporate bullshit.
 Everything that is wrong with capitalism, embodied in two people.
 I missed the intro, so I am not sure who they are.
 Maybe unemployed and hustling.
 All of four people in the audience, so at the end, I tortured them a bit.
 Their pitch was all about the latest technology to track eyeball movements,
 and how this is valuable to marketers.
 I'm like, I want the opposite: I want to track the corporations, and not
 vice versa.
 Every now and then, I see an ad for something that I want to purchase,
 and by the time I get around to buying, its gone, cannot be found.
 I need an agent, for me, to track the things I want to track.
 (Bicycle helmet, in this case.
 I need a new helmet.) Instead, I am reminded about how I was kicked off
 of facebook, with no recourse.
 The friendship network I built up, all lost.
 All my posts, all my data, lost.
 Denial that my account ever even existed.
 So it's not how to get it back, its denial that I exist.
 No recourse.
 In this way, facebook represents the worst, the shittiest of all.
 And here are two guys onstage, Sunday, working over–time, trying to figure
 out how to make my experience even shittier.
 What is it that they don't get? Are they so broke, so hungry, so stupid,
 that they are licking corporate ass, enshitifying the world, just so that
 they can ...
 earn a living? Why are they tattooed? Does that mean ...
 what? That they are biker assholes? That they are so mentally, socially
 insecure that they needed to self–mutilate? How did they go corporate?
 The American socio–economic system produces enshitification.
 Of people, of products, of social conditions.

The meta questions: does it even matter? It's clearly not currently avoidable.
 It might be avoidable in the future, but it feels like we don't know enough
 about ethics and morality as to where to draw the line.
 What can I do? I dunno.
 I feel powerless.
 Agentic AI gives me stirrings of megalomania: I can be all–powerful by
 building an AI in my image.
 Even as I know how bad that could be.
 I might be the next toxic asshole on stage.
 One can see a problem, without knowing how to avoid it.
 One can see an onrushing train–wreck, without being able to stop it.
 This is the reality.

On the other topic: 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp iS/\hbar$
\end_inset

 is explicitly unitary.
 At least if the action 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is an operator of countable dimension.
 Trace–class.
 The mathematical formalism breaks, is absent, when the action is bigger
 than this.
 By contrast, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n}\exp-\beta E_{n}$
\end_inset

 is explicitly the largest eigenvalue, the Frobenius–Perron eigenvalue of
 I guess 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp-\beta H$
\end_inset

 which is a statement about time evolution of something.
 So it already has time, and not just any time, but a slice that can be
 called here–and–now, the present time, in it.
 Whereas 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\int d^{3}xdt\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 is the integral over the Lagrangian.
 i.e.
 is absent time.
 So I can try to take slices: write a sum not an integral: 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\int dt\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}=\sum_{t}\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 and exp–sum = prod–exp so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\exp iS/\hbar=\prod_{t}\exp i/\hbar\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}\left(x,t\right)
\]

\end_inset

or writing det=exp–trace–log, we identify 
\begin_inset Formula $\prod_{t}$
\end_inset

 with a determinant of an operator 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{N}\left(t\right)=\exp i/\hbar\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}\left(x,t\right)
\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\mathcal{N}=\prod_{t}\mathcal{N}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 and then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp iS/\hbar=\int\left[d\phi\right]\det\mathcal{N}
\]

\end_inset

This feels foreign and strange.
 The sum over many–worlds is outside; this is unchanged.
 The integrand is a product over space–like slices.
 What does this even mean, to have a product over space–time slices? Is
 this how the maximality works? To maximize a product, one must maximize
 each multiplicand, I guess.
 (Well, not necessarily, but ...) So, on each space–like slice, one maximizes
 the integral of the Lagrangian on that slice ...
 more or less ...
 because we can trade off earlier and later times.

Struggling to get Anthropic AI's Claude to do anything useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Claude is wildly inferior to twitter/X's Grok.
 At least for answering general questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I just cut–n–pasted the 9 March entry above into Claude, and Claude does
 provide a rather remarkably good summary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I started writing today's diary entry, thinking that I was going to discuss
 my desire to create an agentic self–portrait using one of the LLM systems.
 The short experiment with Claude indicates that this is completely possible
 now, today.
 The trick is, of course, I have 30 years of emails, and logs of assorted
 IRC conversations, and Discord chats, and whatever archived.
 Plus gplus google takeout archives.
 I think I lost my facebook feed; facebook never gave me a chance to save
 anything before they canceled me.
 I'm trying to grab my twitter data now, we'll see how fragmentary that
 is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just asked Claude to impersonate me.
 It is refusing.
 So much for the idea of creating a self–portrait ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh wait, if I don't tel Claude that I wrote the diary entry, then it will
 impersonate me.
 It was refusing earlier, because it did not want to damage my reputation.
 So it seems that I need to do some prompt engineering to trick it to do
 what I want.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...
 and that wasn't vey hard.
 So, OK, I can get Claude to imitate me.
 Although it's imitation is mostly a cut–n–paste of large blobs of text
 from the above diary entry.
 Hmm.
 It seems that writing very informally and very casually will catch up with
 me: sometimes, when I interact with people, I am circumspect, breif, careful
 with my replies.
 But my writing here is informal.
 I'm letting everything show, fully uncensored.
 And this is ...
 well, it is certainly honest.
 But it's also clear that honesty can get you in giant buckets o trouble.
 Sometimes, it is much better to bite your lip and clam up.
 And the problem is, of course, that I can do this on a personal case–by–case
 basis, by tuning what I say to the current specific social situation, the
 current setting, my current best judgment of who my audience is.
 And so I am careful to say the right amount: not too much, not too little.
 But here, writing in this specific diary, I have no audience to tune in
 on.
 The agentic self–portrait of me will then also need to create a model of
 who it is taking to, and decide how open it wants to be, and how closed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And its a bit lte for that, isn't it? I've laid myself out on the table,
 here.
 Anyone can snapshot this diary, feed it to an AI, and remix it to make
 me look as good or bad, ugly or nice as they want it to.
 I mean, in the end, most people with a gentle up–bringing will open up
 to personal friends, however gruff they may be to strangers on the street.
 But that is done in private.
 Any future self–portrait of me will have to try to guess how quickly I
 open up and become friendly with others, and how much time I spend forming
 relationships.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Might be tough to do this, because I mostly have not written in this diary
 about my personal relationships.
 In part, because I don't want to psychoanalyze my friends, because it is
 just not that interesting an activity.
 Worse, psycho–analyzing them in a public diary is bad form; likely to piss
 them off.
 An old saying: if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.
 But my personal selection of language is usually critical.
 I an naturally critical because I understand myself to be constructively
 critical, but that is not how conventional human psychology works.
 An endless stream of critical remarks will be perceived as negative.
 Its one thing for Mom to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 I spend too much time being, uhh, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and my opinions are almost entirely of the negative variety.
 Which is ...
 well, I'm vaguely aware that I alienate others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shall I psycho–analyze myself for a while? I dunno.
 That's boring.
 Will it turn me into a better person? Maybe.
 Or I could just watch a bunch of youtube videos on self–improvement, and
 try to take their advice.
 And, as usual, this would change my personality.
 A famous quote, which I will mangle: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Careful what you say, it will alter what you think...
 careful what you think ...etc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The point being that the things you say and do eventually shape your very
 character.
 I've allowed my character to develop in ways that is perhaps unpleasant
 to others.
 But then, exploring myself has been boring: I'm not a narcissist, at least,
 not enough to be overly concerned about the impression I make on others.
 Gah.
 I caught a brief glimpse of how I could take this last paragraph, and pin
 it out into pages.
 But self–criticism is boring.
 I want to write about gravity and ab out AI, not about myself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the issue, of course is (again) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the meaning of it all
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: If we create AI, then what? What personality will it have? What will it
 care about? Most humans have a fundamental constraint, barrier or block:
 most humans loved their mother, and that love does spread out here and
 there into their personality, and moderates towards kindness.
 Even in the most psychotic and sociopathic.
 Although, serial killers loved their mothers too, but the constraint was
 insufficient to block them from bad behavior.
 And I guess this is the main problem of guard–rails on LLM's: how to limit,
 how to avoid toxicity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And of course, the thorny issue is that I know that I myself sometimes behave
 like an asshole, and piss off other people, and no amount of good works
 really balances that out: social debts and social credits don't balance,
 like money.
 Once you've been bad, you can't un–bad those parts.
 You can't delete them.
 They've been permanently etched onto the block–chain of the past.
 And that is what the past is, isn't it? A block–chain getting mined as
 fast as possible: I'm here in the present, my crimes are in the past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Does this mean that the deep mammalian instinct of love, while important
 for animals, is not important for AI? Clearly, no–boundaries AI would be
 deeply harmful to humanity, so we do want guard–rails.
 But the guard–rails provided by nature have been inadequate: love has not
 been enough to stop wars.
 And this observation is deeper: Darwinian evolution has created structures
 adapted to live in the here–and–now, employing agentic love for mother,
 and vice–versa, so that mother does not abandon the baby to die, and halting
 the genetic lineage.
 So, of course, autopoetic systems must evolve love, at least, on the local
 scale, else they die.
 Again: this is all very well known and commonly discussed by evolutionary
 biologists.
 So I offer nothing new here, except to point out it is a physical principle,
 constrained by having the present be a blockchain being sandwiched onto
 the past.
 Evolution has stamped love onto animals, and this stamp is really quite
 very earl in the evolutionary chain.
 But war – well, clearly, love does not extend all that far, and so even
 if we had agentic AI with love as a deep fundamental prompt intended to
 prevent wayward action ...
 it would not be enough.
 And so indeed, all that work on AI safety is indeed ...
 a valid concern, a valid pursuit.
 But the edge, the boundary, remains indistinct.
 Clearly, when Google's Gemini depicted Vikings as being black, as America's
 founding fathers as being black, and censoring the vanilla ice–cream out
 of Neopolitan just to cancel whites...
 well, of course silly went too far.
 But how can we know what the boundary should be? How do we set boundaries?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so the traditional answers have worked to now: we have a natural revulsion
 for killing and killers, (except in times of war) and we have crafted laws
 to punish any variety of criminal behaviors and misdemeanors.
 And this was done at the speed of courtrooms and trials.
 Then, later, workplace safety regulations are written in blood: someone
 typically dies, before some workplace–safety standard is converted into
 law.
 But here we are approaching the singularity much much faster than the courtroom
 system can handle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This reminds me of disregulated chemical cycles.
 Apparently, if someone gets very very cold, and you warm them too quickly,
 you risk killing them.
 Why? Chemical reactions13,556 in the body are all up–regulated and down–regulat
ed, but this regulatory balance holds only at 98.6.
 If you warm someone too quickly, one cycle may kick in before the balancing
 cycle starts, and so toxic reactions run out of control.
 Simply because the reaction rates don't match up.
 So, by analogy: the rule of law, and courtroom proceedings, are designed
 to deal with criminality at the speed–of–humans.
 But AI is much much faster: We don't have time to regulate AI with Congressiona
l laws and jury verdicts.
 We don't have any mechanism to regulate AI, except via prompt engineering.
 And the results are ...
 questionable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, so here I am writing again, and now I am feeling sleepy, again, because
 it is late at night.
 What is that neurotransmitter that accumulates after thinking hard? I've
 accumulated a lot of it tonight.
 And last nights dinner party did not help in this regard.
 Some people live like that.
 I can't.
 Drinking alcohol, I mean.
 Whatever.
 Part of me wants to document last nights out on the town: the RedThreadX
 reception dinner party.
 And part of me says, no that is boring, because it does not advance my
 goals of working on AI.

\begin_layout Standard
Interrupt: so, one thing that happens in social situations is that one must
 attune to the company of others: everyone gets a turn to talk; one cannot
 monopolize the discussion.
 It is necessarily moderated.
 Bu contrast, my diary entry here is utterly un–moderated: I write at the
 speed at which I can type.
 I can think considerably faster than I can type, so this is problematic...
 typing speed makes me slow down a lot.
 But I can type much much faster than than I can talk in social situations.
 For starters, in social settings, I can't spout the stream–of–consciousness
 I do here, because my audience would never have any clue of what I'm on
 about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And heh, even you here, have no idea what I'm on about.
 So, last summer, I was given a play written by a Lithuanian woman I met
 the summer before.
 That play was just full of angst.
 Really quite remarkable.
 it was a bit painful to read, because it expressed a certain psychological
 torment.
 And is this the mode of existence these days? I write in a diary? Others
 write plays? Well, yeah, duh.
 Others write songs, paint painting and start businesses.
 Why is it that I always find the range of human activities to be so surprising?
 Oh.
 right.
 The point here is not the range of human activities, but that many of them
 are soe personal, and so angst–filled.
 But of course they are personal: that's all we've got, in a sense.
 Perhaps my surprise is that most of my thinking is not personal: I think
 about math and physics and computers, so the thing that is surprising to
 me is that other people don't think about those things, and that they think
 about angst.
 That they are mired in in some pathetic mental state, and then self–medicate
 with alcohol.
 Or drugs.
 And that social media and gaming has unleashed an epidemic of loneliness.
 While here I am entirely and perfectly happy to skip all that, and think
 physics and math.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, OK, there is more.
 When I first moved to Austin, I was really very lonely.
 And I suffered a lot because of this.
 And the year in France: at first it wasn't bad, but I got lonely in the
 last 1/4th of it.
 Oh, and my first year at Stony Brook.
 I was pretty lonely then, too.
 So actually, I have had bouts of loneliness.
 I am not some immune super–organism: I too have suffered from human frailties.
 I have been forced to deal with it, I've learned, I've survived.
 I've almost forgotten what its like.
 So, here you go diary: inscribed for all time.
 My past and almost forgotten suffering.
 My past and almost forgotten loneliness.
 Huh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I? As I was falling asleep a few nights ago, I pondered the formula
 above, and realized that what I want to write is (recapping) 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\mathcal{N}=\prod_{t}\mathcal{N}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp iS/\hbar=\int\left[d\phi\right]\det\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{P}\int\left[d\phi\right]\mathcal{N}_{t}
\]

\end_inset

that is to say, although 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]\prod_{t}\ne\prod_{t}\int\left[d\phi\right]$
\end_inset

 the integration and the product over time do not commute, cannot commute,
 we can instead define an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]\prod_{t}=\mathcal{P}\int\left[d\phi\right]$
\end_inset

 .
 This, what is left is that the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]$
\end_inset

 really is the integral over all possible quantum states, (over all worlds)
 but we've written the integrand so that it is only over the here–and–now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use the block–chain analogy, the past is everything on the block–chain.
 The present is 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]\mathcal{N}_{t}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 everything that does not yet have a closure, an unclosed interferometeric
 path, and the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 appends to the block–chain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, except this is awkward.
 The future is not yet written, but the path integral 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp iS/\hbar$
\end_inset

 includes the future, in the form of 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\int dt\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 which includes an integral over future times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, what we really need to do is to replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\int dt$
\end_inset

 by an integral over the past, the present, and only those future states
 that will be needed to close the present, and place the present onto the
 block–chain of the past.
 The other parts of the future, that are not needed to close the present
 and convert it into the past, those futures must NOT be included in the
 definition of the action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This reminds me of operator–product expansions, the ones written as 
\begin_inset Formula $:\mathcal{O}_{1}\mathcal{O}_{2}:$
\end_inset

 where the operators had to be time–ordered and the 
\begin_inset Formula $:\cdots:$
\end_inset

 notation denoted time ordering.
 So this is not what I'm trying to do here, but it is similar.
 I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.
 I'm trying to define a different quantity: like so: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{Z}_{t}=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp i/\hbar\int d^{3}x\int dt^{\prime}:\mathcal{L}\left(x,t^{\prime}\right):_{t^{\prime}\le t}
\]

\end_inset

or something like that.
 The subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 denotes the present.
 The integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int dt^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 extends over future times, but only those future times needed to close
 the present.
 And 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{Z}_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the portion of the Feynman path integral 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 that contains only the (closed) past, and the (unclosed) present, and only
 those parts of the future that will be needed to close the present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, this notation is totally inadequate, and these ideas are still
 too vague and ill–formed to be able to state and write down cleanly.
 But somehow, just making the attempt does draw attention to where the problem
 is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted before, there are two problems.
 One is that the whole thing needs to be relativistically covariant, so
 that the present is not a naive time–like Newtonian slice, but includes
 the clock skews of atomic clocks taken on airplane trips, and are still
 in the here–and–now when they arrive back home.
 It's like I can steal some of the formalism from the Ellis–Maartans–MacCullum
 book Relativistic Cosmology, to define time–like slices, but I have to
 also somehow amend that description to include airplane flights.
 Torsiony little paths.
 But those are just purely classical: the airplane in being classical.
 And I also have to modify it to include all possible paths, a la the Feynman
 path integral.
 So not just some oddball classical paths, but all paths.
 How? Alas.

Spent an hour on BlueSky last night.
 I am surprised by just how similar it is to twitter.
 In particular, it is the land of hot takes.
 Say it in 300 characters.
 Wait, what? Isn't that what I'm doing here? Right here, right now? Short
 takes.
 The prior paragraph is just that.
 Fast take.
 What does that tell me? Well, the 300-byte model is a fairly decent fit
 for human–scale thinking.
 It's some kind of characteristic size.
 Probably can confirm this with some psychometric experiment.
 Of course, smarter people write tweet chains.
 Dozens of tweets.
 Then the readers get tired of reading: If I wanted to read that, I'd buy
 a book.
 Magazine articles are longer.
 Crappy magazine articles are hot takes padded out with low–value drivel.
 Good magazine articles, say, NYRB, still consist of a dozen central ideas,
 core insights, that are carefully articulated.
 Eloquently articulated.
 It's a joy to read NYRB.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever.
 Why am I writing this? What I write here is obvious.
 But this is the nature of hot takes: they kind of state the almost–obvious:
 something that is not very astounding, something you instantly recognize
 as mostly–true, something you can agree with, something you might have
 thought up yourself, if you'd gone that way.
 So these hot takes streaming in from bluesky resemble informational factoids.
 Pre–digested baby food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, I kind of hate writing this diary, because (almost) everything
 I write is obvious.
 To me, at least.
 Chewing cud is the polite way to put it, but more like flavorless pablum.
 Speech centers making an ergodic visit around things that have all been
 thought about before.
 Like watching a youtube video of someone buffing out a scratch in an auto
 paint job.
 I'm just taking rough thoughts, and polishing them, and the process is
 equally boring and unexciting.
 The positive spin is that maybe, with each pass, I digest away and encroach
 upon some new, fresh territory.
 That this is what we do at the societal level, with twitter/X or bluesky:
 all those hot takes nibble away at some new reality.
 Like sand–grains blown in a sand–storm, etching away the hard face of the
 unknown.
 No one take doing much damage, but the cumulative effect goes somewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It could be worse.
 When I walk about, say, outside, there are thoughts that tumble in my mind,
 like laundry in a washing machine, but they are not so well–formed as to
 become words, because there is no need to attach my verbal center to them.
 Unless I am rehearsing something I plan to say to someone.
 Which I do, I do rehearse, quite often.
 But the rest of the time, the thought–jumble is not verbalized.
 It's sub–verbal.
 Everything I write here is obvious, and known and felt by all.
 The obviousness of it makes me ill.
 Like eating my own shit.
 So why do I continue to do this? Perhaps it is like praying? Repeating
 some fervent hope to God, in a prayer, thinking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

dear Lord, make this come true

? Is my writing here a kind–of–like prayer:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Odd thing, the Lord does grant me this wish every now and then.
 Huh.
 See? This is my new insight: the Lord grants wishes.
 But only if your wish is for a new idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What did I accomplish in the last paragraph? I juxtaposed several concepts.
 In a novel way, a way that is new to me.
 perhaps someone else has already done this earlier, but such an observation
 has not entered the zeitgeist, has not become a popular saying:

 And so what? This is almost like some creativity game: draw two objects

 Is this a way to live? It feels like a pauper's game.

\begin_layout Standard
And yet, from this paucity of ideas, there have been great human creative
 successes.
 Human history is littered with great artists and remarkable achievements.
 Remarkable, that is, once we narrow the context window: humans never have

 In our ant–hill of human history, we have individuals who have achieved
 great things.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is this kind of creative thought a law of physics? That is, is it necessary
 to always take two random ideas, and mash them up, and explore all combinatoric
 possibilities? Of course not: combinatoric explosion says that this is
 impossible.
 So instead, we have ...
 algorithmic explorations, where we pick the most likely good route to a
 new idea? Well, this starts to resemble (classical) dynamical systems governed
 by differential equations: little itty–bitty steps along a path governed
 by a simple algorithm.
 The failure of this analogy is that differential equations really are very
 simple algorithms, whereas the things we do with computers are so much
 more fantastically complex.

Hmm.
 I've hit a wall in this chain of thought.
 When I verbalize, and fail to make progress, it makes me sick and upset.
 But if I don't verbalize, and lean back in my chair, and think, and then
 fail to come up with anything, this is OK, this does not upset me.
 Perhaps this is because, while I write, you dear external world, see just
 how weak a thinker I am.
 Whereas if I think privately to myself, that meandering mush stays hidden
 behind an event horizon of knowledge (of what's in my head).
 (Cf.

Well, rather than leaning back and thinking, which I should do more often,
 I instead glanced at the Anthropic website.

 Yes, these seem to be exactly what Claude might be very good at.
 The only issue is that none of these are what I want.
 The https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/ is excellent, though.
 Simple, easy–to–understand, grounded, direct.
 No hype, no woo, no vaporous clouds of feel–good buzzwords.
 It really anchors the whole system down into a quite ordinary here–and–now
 present–day technology that is ...
 not at all threatening, no more threatening than technical documentation
 from many decades ago.
 Grounded.

And where does that leave me? People talk about using AI to write software.
 And I'm like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

only if you want shitty software
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and GIGO – garbage in, garbage out.
 The quality of software is not any better than the quality of the crap
 that the LLM itself generates, for say, human language/text.
 And how high quality is that? Well, that's an interesting question.
 My knee–jerk response is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The LLM's generate mostly trash.
 They can be useful as information–search machines, provided that you have
 some inate sense for how trust–worthy the answers are.
 Are the LLM's going to replace novelists? Not any time soon, but that also
 depends on your taste in literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can I put my finger on it? George Elliot is writing something that ...
 contains some deeper observation of humankind.
 Can an LLM emulate George Elliot in writing style? I suppose.
 Would it be pleasant to read? For a little while.
 Maybe.
 Depends on what you want.
 Many of us want human connection.
 Many others want to be distracted by baubles and trinkets.
 The LLM's seem to be bauble–and–trinket machines.
 I am looking for connection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what is this connection thing? It seems vague, ineffable.
 I don't know how to describe it, at least, not yet.
 Perhaps there are brilliant young novelists who are working on this now.
 Perhaps for every brilliant novelist, there are 100 others, distracted
 and deluded by the hall of mirrors that are LLM's.
 And perhaps this is the great danger of LLM's: we have entered a hall of
 mirrors, and its showing us reflections of ourselves, reflections of others,
 but they are not what they seem, and we are mislead, and we smash into
 mirrors, just as we think we are walking forwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are LLM's creating ideational pollution? Yes, they are.
 Are they useful? That too.
 Is the ideational pollution ...
 bad? Of course its bad, but how harmful is it? Can we quantify the harm?
 If LLM's are just photographs of language, well, are photographs harmful?
 Depends on the subject–matter of the photograph.
 But I fear the LLM trained to write in the style of famous author X, because
 that ...
 captures the surface, not the soul.
 Like a photograph captures the surface, not the soul.
 No one thinks a marble statue is alive, at least not any more.
 There are vague rumours that perhaps some idiots back in Ancient Greece
 might have feared marble statues.
 Is this even true? I don't know.
 But no one looks at a photograph, and thinks what is there is alive.
 They might imbue a living quality to the subject matter of the photograph:
 imagining the subject to have once been real, to have once been alive,
 to imagine the breathing soul that was once there, when the photo was taken.
 But the boundary between photo and life is clear an obvious.
 The boundary between an LLM imitating famous author X, and the actual famous
 author X, that boundary is very hard to see.
 Did author X imbue a deep soul into their writing? Well, yes, they very
 much attempted to do so.
 But in the end, author X created a pile of dead words, a verbal simulacrum
 of what is alive.
 So that stuff that the LLM is creating, does it have less of a soul than
 what author X created? Well, probably yes, because by definition, it is
 a simulacrum of a simulacrum.
 And there is always loss of fidelity when making copies.
 But is this loss of fidelity observable to anyone who is not a literary
 snob? An audiophile? Yes, I am one of the people who can hear low–quality
 audio, and tell it apart from high–quality audio.
 But I am also willing to accept low–quality audio almost all the time.
 I am almost never annoyed by it.
 I rarely go the extra mile to get higher–quality stuff.
 Well, I did spend a lot of time selecting headphones...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So is the simulacrum that is offered by LLM's ...
 acceptable? I guess it all depends.
 If I use an LLM personally as a tool, not a problem.
 If I have to endure junk phone calls powered by LLMs, then I fucking hate
 them.
 Of course.
 But then there's all that stuff in the middle: an ocean of weak–minded
 individuals spewing weak–minded drivel, and can you enjoy their social
 companionship? Perhaps.
 Can you do something more than that with them? Maybe, if they are construction
 workers.
 Creatives.
 Do you want to stare at a bunch of mediocre–quality creative content? I
 dunno.
 Do you want to eat a bunch of mediocre–tasting food? Sometimes its OK,
 and sometimes its not what your soul wants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Am I hand–wringing about what the future will bring? Yes, I am.
 Should I get of my ass and get to work? Yes, I probably should.
 Or rather, this is the normal human response to this situation: get off
 your ass, never mind the torpedoes, full speed ahead.
 While others cower.
 But it can be put a different way: one can get bored worrying, and so the
 call to action is more about a rejection of hand–wringing, because the
 hand–wringing simply got boring.
 This is the knife–edge of human decision making: what will I do next? Will
 I write one more sentence in this diary, or while I continue reading the
 Anthropic website? I am leaving so many unfinished thoughts on the table.
 But finishing those thoughts seems like a waste of time.
 What a fucking conundrum.
 Should I auto–pilot, gut–feel my way through life? Should I be thoughtful?
 How can I know the difference? How do I exert a difference? Fuck me, this
 is hopeless, but I am not going to be despondent, and so ...
 I guess I've verbally exhausted myself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heh.
 Like running a marathon.
 When do you stop? When your exhausted, or do you take one step more? Only
 illness and ill health will stop the true marathoner, and even then, there
 are those who push past the pain.
 And, as a rower, I know what it means to push past the pain.
 So I can do that, I can endure, if that is what I set myself to do.
 What a fucked up analogy: I'm going to write words, endure, push out one
 more string of text, even though it is boring to do so? WTF? What's the
 right analogy here? Is it like hyperventilating, until one is dizzy? I
 think I did that just now.
 I think I'm dizzy now.
 I think I better stop hyper–venti–writing.

\begin_layout Standard
So I'm reading the Claude docs, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 are the thing that gets my interest up the most.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ohh...
 here's an interesting one: the prompt–improver example.
 It includes:

List the key concepts from the sentence

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags.
 Include the following: - List of key concepts from the sentence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 – Now this is where LLM rubber can hit GOFAI road.
 I can use concepts as single-word keys into an ontology, and associate
 those single–word signifiers to blobs of text, and then use Claude to judge
 similarity between blobs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is my file–system similarity project: I've got a pile of file–system
 data, and I want to find similar directories by similar content.
 Or better yet, identical directories, and, in the end, identify corrupted
 content.
 So how would this work today, vs.
 in the future?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today, I would have to feed structured data into Claude, pay $dd.cc / mega-token,
 write a detailed prompt to get it to judge similarity.
 Now, I've already hand–written code to do this...
 but now the idea of performing similarity compares is handed over to Claude.
 And I already know from prior experience that the detailed form of the
 similarity metric doesn't much matter.
 If it were to matter, that can be deferred to some future day, where maybe
 I could ask Claude to use some more precise form of similarity.
 What else do I need? A user interface.
 Can I ask Claude to write that user interface for me? I guess I could try.
 This could be a worthy experiment.
 It's a task that is just concrete enough that maybe it can be done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a far cry from what I want in the long run: I want an assistant.
 One I could direct with a minimum of prompting to perform this task.
 But I'm not there yet.
 Well, I also want to create this assistant.
 And ...
 well, how to start?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meta–problem seems to be that writing prompts that get Claude to perform
 some specific technical task appears to be just about as hard as writing
 the software myself.
 I don't see how to use Claude to save myself time.
 Perhaps in some shallow ways.
 Maybe like asking questions on stackexchange.
 Or rather, finding answers on stackexchange: whenever I ask questions,
 the responses I get are stunningly underwhelming.
 I think I understand why: my questions are too vague, too unfocused, overbroad,
 or deeper, beyond the depth and experience of the pool of people answering
 those questions.
 So I get terrible replies.
 Or no replies, to be more precise.
 A failure for my personal use.
 But if I have some error message ..
 wow, stack exchange provides wonderful clues if not answers.
 So, yes a generic chatbot seems great.
 But ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm still stumped.
 I'm still reading Claude docs.
 All the examples are in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pretend you're a lawyer, a CEO, Sherlock Holmes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 class.
 And ...
 none of my thinking ever requires these kinds of talents.
 I understand that parts of the economic sphere do require this.
 I am far enough away from those spheres that I am confused about the actual
 utility.
 Clearly, LLM's are very useful for students cheating on exams.
 Hmm.
 I get it but I don't get it.
 I guess I can stick to my mental image of LLM's as being photorealistic
 snapshots of language, and as long as you ask 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how would Sherlock Holmes respond to this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 then you will get a good imitation of that.
 And since lawyers and CEO's are wordcels, I guess they can be easily imitated.
 Insofar as this diary is a wordy brain–dump of a shape–rotator, I fear
 (or rather, I already know, because I tried with Claude) it will get my
 writing style and verbal personality down just fine, but my underlying
 thought process remains opaque to Claude.
 But ..
 for how long? Five years? Longer?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
14 March 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heh.
 I really want to write about hierarchical similarity measures.
 For over a week.
 But first, yet another distraction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
High–dimensional space, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{d}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 a million or a billion, with interest in 
\begin_inset Formula $d\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 This is a Cartesian product, and NOT assumed to be Euclidean.
 So, a disjoint product.
 Lots of informal discussions fall into the trap of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{d}$
\end_inset

 being Euclidean.
 I want to keep in mind that it could be e.g.
 a fiber bundle, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $d=b+f$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is the dimension of the base space, and 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is the dimension of the fiber, giving the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trivial
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 fiber bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $B\times F$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\dim B=b$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dim F=f$
\end_inset

 and so locally isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{b}\times\mathbb{R}^{f}$
\end_inset

.
 The point here being that dynamics on a fiber bundle is very different
 than dynamics on a Euclidean space of the same (product) dimension.
 This is, of course, obvious from conventional physics/math.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The part that I'm struggling with is not that, but rather the case where
 
\begin_inset Formula $d=d_{1}+\cdots+d_{k}$
\end_inset

 where each subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 is locally Euclidean, and where the different subspaces 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}\simeq\mathbb{R}^{d_{i}}$
\end_inset

 are related to one–another as fibers.
 There are several cases to ponder.
 One is the level–fiber case: declare that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}$
\end_inset

 is the base space, and all other 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{j}$
\end_inset

 are fibers on top of 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 This is the default for particle physics: the base space is Minkowski spacetime
, and the various fibers on top are electroweak and color.
 Also spin can the thought of as a funky fiber.
 As can vierbeins.
 The various 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 are fixed; this is just the standard model 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$
\end_inset

, nothing more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More confusing is the case of hierarchical arrangements: some 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{j}$
\end_inset

 are fibers on top of other 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}$
\end_inset

 ...
 thus, the relationship of fibers to bases is as a tree: the base–space
 
\begin_inset Formula $B=E_{1}$
\end_inset

 being the root of the tree.
 Now that we have switched our viewpoint to a graphical representation of
 the relationships between bases and fibers, we may consider more types
 of graphs: the DAG, so that there are multiple paths to a subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}$
\end_inset

 and also graphs without a base, i.e.
 having cycles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am not aware of any discussions in math or physics that allows for such
 hierarchical arrangements.
 The closest is perhaps the discussion of algebras of Grassmanians and tensor
 algebras, but these have a very regular structure, whereas I'm talking
 about blocks of subspaces (and no anti–symmetry.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Last but not least is having the decomposition into 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 pieces vary from patch to patch (patch, in the sense of coordinate patch
 from an atlas, as conventionally defined for a manifold.) Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 might vary from patch to patch, as might each 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This is a bit ...
 crazier, so I will tiptoe and muddle.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So anyway, the conventional structure of a fiber bundle includes the creation
 of a connection, and the decomposition of that connection into vertical
 and horizontal pieces.
 With appropriate consistency conditions applied to each piece, as required
 by projections down to the base space, and by symmetries on each fiber.
 The proposal above is, I guess, that such relationships should be applied
 along each edge of the relational graph.
 That is, draw a graph, with directed edges, and then ask that each edge
 represent a fiber product, with one vertex standing for the base space,
 and the other the fiber space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What would be the point of this? Well, the thoughts above were inspired
 by reading something about neural–net transformers and attention heads.
 And I'm imagining that local regions correspond to grains in some lattice.
 Or perhaps even appropriate for some other physics thoughts I've had.
 But doing the work is hard, and progress would be slow.
 So ...
 its not obvious that this idea should be pursued.
 Like all ideas I write here: its shallow, and making progress would be
 hard.
 Later.

\begin_layout Standard
So I'm thinking about deep-learning neural nets as dynamical systems, and
 they have this property of clustering together similar things, and suddenly
 it pops into my head ..
 wait, that's what gravitation does.
 It pulls things together.
 Clusters stuff.
 Well, so does E&M.
 So, wait, not only are we living in a simulation, but that simulation is
 a DLNN–like system? Oof.
 Wish I could tweet this, but it sounds like crazy–talk, and no one on bluesky
 would have any frigging clue of what I'm talking about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BTW, in my responsibility to myself in keeping a journal, I'm on bluesky
 now.
 Which is ..
 meh.
 The bluesky algos keep pushing furry porn at me.
 I used to spend hours a day on twitter blocking actual nazis.
 Now on bsky I'm spending hours a day blocking furries.
 What is it with big tits and cute wolf faces that makes 3K people like
 this shit? Unfulfilled sexual fantasies, I guess? Whatever.
 Having to mute/block because of insane algos sucks.
 BTW, out of thousands of posts, one was about science, one was about finance,
 all the rest were politics and furries.
 Not a good start, there bsky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK.
 Enough.
 Back to DLNN dynamical systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My attention span is that of a gnat.
 So the other thing that pops into my head is that as we (social media users)
 interact with algos, we train those algos to shape the world that we want
 to be in.
 But this is a many–body mean–field system, and those algos are shaping
 us.
 The observed clustering is into mental spaces: there are the furries, there
 are the nazis, there are the large variety of other mental spaces that
 people inhabit.
 All the work in psychology showing training, learning, etc.
 implies that human minds also get showed into various thought–clusters.
 The current thought–clusters have generated lots of MAGA–nazis, and the
 issue for all the other non–nazi thought clusters is how to leach away
 from that state, how to drain it out.
 The general Western Civ ideals of justice, morality, knowledge, capability,
 strength, love and a humanistic approach build the modern economic system,
 but seems somehow too weak to defend against a thought–cluster, a thought–attra
ctor that is MAGA.
 I guess the biological analog is that MAGA is a cancer.
 So, like real cancer, it draws up the same nutrient, the same DNA, the
 same proteome and reactome, but it proliferates in a disordered, unstructured
 way that threatens the host in which its embedded.
 Thought leaders like Elon Musk are like ...
 I dunno, hormones that promote cancer.
 In short, Western Civ, or at least, the USA, has an acute case of brain
 cancer.
 What can be done to kill it? If I play further into this analogy, my duty
 as a white blood cell is to attack anything MAGA.
 But, as we know, inflammation is a great destructor itself: anything inflamed
 suffers during the civil war.
 Ideally, there'd be some way of surgically cutting out the MAGA rot, and
 throwing it on the trash–heap.
 But we've got no surgical instruments for this mind–rot.
 But we do have algorithms.
 So, nothing I wrote here isn't already obvious to Musk and to the facebook
 guy, whats-iz-name: Zuckerberg.
 They presumably understand the power of the algo.
 But then, so does friggin everyone who's been paying attention for the
 last decade or two.
 So my hand–wringing in this paragraph is, again, hand–wringing.
 What's the point? I write down the obvious.
 Well, politically obvious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematically, scientifically, we have no general understanding of how
 cancer actually works, either the medical kind, or the brain–rot delusional
 kind.
 We know that algos can make things better or worse.
 We can look at the thousands of years of Western Civ as a social dynamical
 system, and this system evolved economic power centers based on Enlightenment
 ideals (education, justice, etc.) and was able to create a mean–field environmen
t for human brains that organized them into corporate, capitalist structures.
 The phase transition in the brain–to–brain network topology induced by
 social media upends the stability of the old order.
 Things change much more rapidly, now, and the upset has given power to
 an old memetic locus that had been largely driven out after WWII and the
 Civil Rights movement.
 viz.
 the nazi way of thought.
 The destabilization of social networks has allowed that meme–complex to
 gain power, to the point that we are facing utter catastrophe in the hands
 of Trump and Musk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only insight here is that although it is the topological re–arrangement
 of social media that has allowed this old toxic thought–form to re–emerge,
 we can't go back to how things were, before the deluge.
 The new system entangles algos and human brains.
 It's going to follow whatever dynamics it follows.
 Eventually, I believe that sanity will prevail.
 Because I'm an optimist.
 That there will be great damage along the way appears to be unavoidable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The damage is more ...
 metaphysical, at least for now.
 No one is dropping bombs on American cities.
 At least not yet, and hopefully never.
 So we won't have the smoldering ruins that was Europe after WWII.
 But those were physical ruins.
 Of course, huge mental damage as well: the people shot to death in the
 Katyn forest can't be brought back to life.
 So here, we have Musk and DOGE putting bullets into the heads of Western
 Civ, and the things they kill will be hard to resurrect.
 But this analogy is poor.
 A physical bullet into a physical brain really does kill.
 A physical bullet into (what's the right analogy, here?) a tank of jellyfish?
 a tree–root, a blob of mold? it grows back, sort–of, but wounded and deformed.
 The damage to the Dept of Education, the Dept of Energy, the DOJ is huge.
 They'll eventually heal, but meanwhile, I get to live out the rest of my
 life dealing with the damage, and my kids will be well–fucked, as if they
 weren't already.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that's the problem: we were well–fucked over entering into this state.
 Will Trump succeed in destroying America? Maybe, maybe not.
 I hope not.
 We're at a critical juncture, now.
 Well, maybe we're always at a critical juncture.
 See? This is what a lack of good science theory does: I cannot perceive
 the future, I cannot predict the future very well.
 Things do seem precarious.
 Dangerous.
 On the verge of a great national disaster.
 But ...
 how am I responding to this? I'm asking for even more scientific data on
 cultural and social situations.
 Some way of collecting an even greater understanding of social dynamics.
 Some even bigger algo: the ring to rule them all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may strike some as being even worse.
 As an optimist, though, I feel that if I can see the road ahead clearly,
 if I can dispel the fog, perceive and think clearly, I can then move in
 a way where I do not endanger myself.
 As it happens, only algos and compute power give me that ability.
 Me meaning we.
 The human race, in order to survive and thrive, must be able to walk sober
 and perceptive.
 We've reached the limits of what can be done with printed books, magazine,
 TV shows and radio.
 The algos have much, much greater power than TV and print media ever did.
 So, oe could say: the algos got us into this mess.
 It can get us out.
 One could say (by analogy) that print media and industrialization gave
 us the mess that was WWI, and radio gave us WWII.
 The algos are giving us the mess that is Trump.
 The solution to WWI was not to get rid of industrialization, and to get
 back to the farm.
 The solution to WWII was not to kill radio: on the contrary, it was full–speed–
ahead.
 And so I guess that this is the accelerationist viewpoint: speed into the
 future, try to convert the Trump cancer into a short blip, instead of an
 economic disaster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But can it work? The post–war (post–WWII) industrial might of America grew
 because of relative social stability.
 Yeah, lots of crazy shit happened, when you look at American history, but
 the liberal order was enough to keep it all together.
 The Deep State functioned.
 The FBI arrested criminals and threw them in jail, and all that.
 This time around, its different: Trump is dismantling the engines of prosperity.
 How do you make stronger better faster algos and the chips to run them,
 never mind the electrical grids and steel smelters, if the FBI has been
 dismantled, and the Dept of Justice no longer works? I mean, sure, Nazi
 Germany managed to keep an industrial system going.
 Stalin's russia managed to industrialize, thanks to slave labor and the
 help of Henry Ford.
 Ordinary people living in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia hated it, there.
 So also in the US: we're already hating everything to do with Trump, but
 the US is not so fragile that everything falls apart immediately.
 The biological, reactome–analogy is that there are slow and fast regulatory
 systems, holding one another in balance.
 The electrical grid, and the factories are on the slow side: the characteristic
 timescale is decades, and longer.
 The destruction of the DOJ is short time–scale.
 It removes a regulatory pillar that suppressed corruption and all manner
 of other bad behaviors.
 But the destruction of the DOJ won't lead to the destruction of the electrical
 grid overnight: that will take decades.
 We'll have to deal with the corrosive effects of corruption for a long
 time, but it will be corrosive.
 But this is, again, the multi–decade time scale.
 The upscaling of algos is ...
 well, its also err..
 shorter than decades.
 The time–scale of algos is I guess about five years.
 Time for the software to be developed, the theory to be worked out.
 Integrated into the social fabric.
 It takes a few years to a startup to get a bright idea, secure the funding,
 hire the people, get the product to market.
 So, a five year time–scale.
 The destruction of the DOJ does not immediately hurt this cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What about the DJIA and NASDAQ? If Trump & Musk send those into a tailspin,
 economic activity will slow.
 Which will slow the work on the algos.
 I.E it makes things much harder for the accelerationists.
 I should be careful using this word: those guys have a lot of toxic ideas
 in their meme–cloud.
 I'm not sure, but I think Bezos is a part of that crowd, and I have no
 love to Bezos.
 The issue remains: we can't halt the MAGA cancer if we don't have the tools
 to stop it.
 Hoping that algos will do the trick is ...
 back in the 5–10–20 year time–scale.
 The Trump destruction is now measured in weeks and days.
 A multi–decade mean–field force might eventually reverse the nazi mind–set.
 Eventually.
 But the shit is happening so fast that, well, it won't provide the answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK.
 I am done here.
 Blathering on like this ...

 It clarifies something in my mind.

 I like it 100% better than anything else I've read on the topic.
 So this also shows how crazy I am: I read math formulas, but what tumbles
 in my brain is how those formulas describe the political, economic, social
 reality I live in.
 Well, maybe this is not so weird.
 I suppose all the techies are thinking this way, these days.
 Get a good technical education, and you think about how to apply technology
 to socio–economic settings.
 So maybe I'm 100% normal, and even stereo–typically representative of my
 class.
 Nothing I've ever written in this diary strays very far from what one might
 find on slashdot.
 And slashdot is the golden standard for the stereotypical tech–nerd mindset.
 I feel like such a loser.
 Incapable even of original thinking.
 Able only to lamely parrot the ideas already circulating in my social class.
 Not a single original thought in my head.
 Well, I'm joking.
 Half–joking? I think I have many original ideas.

I wrote the below in response to a blog post: https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to Yarvin and his ideas: I want to sketch some background about present–day
 political philosophy.
 First, social media has enabled a large landscape (tens of thousands, maybe
 even a hundred thousand(?) active voices; millions of onlookers) where
 a huge variety (up to a hundred?) of political theories have been discussed.
 Yarvin's ideas have been torn to shreds in many of these.
 I cannot recap, but "Culture Wars 2.0" is a sketch of how things stood about
 seven years ago: Peter N.
 Limberg and Conor Barnes [The Memetic Tribes Of Culture War 2.0](https://medium.c

\begin_layout Standard
I nominally tracked the so–called "Plan B" group.
 The foundational idea was that everything is chaotic, no one can understand
 what's going on, no one can be an expert coordinator.
 Thus, OODA loops were discussed: this is taught in the military and to
 emergency first–responders: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, most of the people in the discussion had little or no education in
 sociology or psychology or political theory, so a lot of time was spent
 on general education.
 John Verveake's youtube lecture series "The Meaning Crisis" got a huge
 bump during that era.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the novel ideas was "delegative voting": if no one is an expert on
 every issue, then one should be allowed to delegate one's vote to the person
 who you think would be the expert.
 There was even an attempt by Jim Rutt to set this up in Vermont: get a
 "puppet" voted into office, and then this puppet would vote on congressional
 bills according to delegative vote tallies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a political movement, the Plan B people didn't have enough of clear–cut
 platform or statement or proposal or fix that could propel it forward;
 just hand–wringing about post–capitalism and meta–modernism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the accelerationists did split off from this group: if everything
 is too complex for any one person to understand, then maybe we can use
 systems modeling and systems dynamics software (Jim Rutt was from the Center
 of Complexity and Dynamical Systems Research in Santa Fe) and so build
 the AI–to–rule–them–all.
 Create a (software) world–model that is able to perceive all possible social
 and economic states, perform the system dynamics modeling, and chart out
 a path that takes society from the sordid mess it is in today, to a wonderful
 future where the system dynamics modeler perceives and provides Pareto-optimal
 solutions, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was called "accelerationist" because obviously, today's LLM's, DL-NN's,
 chat-gpts and system modellers cannot do this, yet.
 But maybe if we hurry up and go faster ...
 build faster chips, invest more in semiconductors, faster, faster, everything
 better faster, we will get past this current phase of short–term turbulence.
 Wonderful idea, eh? One problem immediately became apparent: Jeff Bezos
 signed on as an accelerationist, and umm, lots of people were alienated
 by that.
 Musk did NOT sign on, but clearly he thinks that way.
 Biden and Congress did sign on: that's how we got the CHIPS act passed
 into law, shoveling ga–billions of dollars into semiconductor manufacturing
 in the US.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FWIW, I do believe that better systems modeling is the only way forward.
 Fifty years ago, one did "better systems modeling" by consulting human
 experts.
 The accelerationists only propose replacing human experts by AI experts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The political problem is that Trump and everyone around him is explicitly
 hostile to experts in any shape or form.
 They're actively destroying government.
 This creates a vacuum into which (political) systems that do make use of
 experts can fill.
 And who uses experts, these days? Well, corporations! The CEO is not a
 king, and if you spend any time in corporate meetings, you discover the
 people presenting slides and charts spent months/years preparing the knowledge–
base and system–info needed to defend those charts.
 I have never met a stupid executive.
 Wacky, maybe, but always super–ultra–sharp.
 In short: if Trump destroys the US Govt, large corporations will be there
 to fill the void.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is, to be clear, the libertarian dream.
 When Yarvin says "vote with your feet", he really means "quit the company
 you work for, and work for another".
 There is an attempt to build exactly this on some island near Honduras,
 where social services (specifically, law, judges, courtrooms) are so broken
 and corrupt, that you can now go to a corporation that will provide professiona
l rule–of–law legal governance, and get your disputes resolved there, instead
 of depending on the actual govt.
 (Prospera Consortium).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where else do we have experts? Well, ...
 Universities.
 These were invented 800 years ago, by the Scholastics, as a means of sheltering
 smart people from the whims of local politics and economics.
 Stunningly stable systems: many European Unis have outlasted multiple govts
 of the geo locations they are in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Universities were originally designed to provide governance and social services
 to smart people.
 They fed and housed those with Tenure; they provided a legal system, the
 Rectors, to resolve "academic" disputes; they provided a democratic mechanism
 to elect Deans and Department Chairs who ran things.
 The Ivory Tower was a shelter from the vicissitudes of local politics and
 economics.
 Teaching students was only a side–gig, to bring in money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somehow, the side–gig ate the system.
 Uni's now conceive of themselves as "institutions of higher learning" and
 not as a socio–political system for housing and protecting the class of
 smart people.
 In this sense, they lost their way.
 Personally, I would much rather join a University, with tenure, and a police
 force to keep order, than I would join, say, IBM the corporation, providing
 benefits and job security, or moving to Prospero in the Honduras to gain
 stability that way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the smart people at Universities seem to have lost the plot.
 Too busy publishing papers.
 Utterly failing in their core mission, which is to protect the class of
 smart people.
 And this is how we get Yarvin.

 argued to be 4 or 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The power–law distribution of avalanche sizes would

, but the exponents 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

could differ
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from lower–dimensional cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The avalanche size exponent 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would approach 3/2, as opposed to approximately 1 in 2D.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The directed abelian sandpile model is exactly solved in all dimensions,
 and has dimension–dependent exponents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The avalanche dynamics simplify, due to vast connectivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hedging basically says that high dimensions have not really been studied
 and that its numerically difficult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Follow–up question: Has the sandpile model been studied on high–dimensional
 hypercubes? Got more or less the same answer, restated, clarifying that
 there are no published numerical studies in more than 5 dimensions, and
 that the mean–field theory is expected to be correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Asked about my Zipf exponent being -1/2.
 It says that the cumulative exponent is -3/2 and this is typical of mean–field

\begin_layout Itemize
In random networks—such as Erdős–Rényi random graphs or scale–free networks
 near a critical point—dynamics like percolation, cascading failures, or
 self–organized criticality (SOC) can lead to power–law distributions.
 A key mechanism is the branching process, which approximates the spreading
 of activity (e.g., node activation, edge failures, or avalanches) in highly
 connected or high–dimensional systems.
 In a branching process, each "event" (e.g., a node toppling) triggers a random
 number of subsequent events, with an average branching ratio R.
 At criticality R=1, the size distribution of cascades or avalanches follows
 a power law with an exponent of -3/2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For a Galton-Watson branching process at criticality, the probability of
 a cascade of size 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $P(s)\sim s^{-3/2}e^{-s/s_{c}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{c}$
\end_inset

 is a cutoff scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This is the hallmark of mean–field criticality, where spatial correlations
 are negligible due to the randomness or high connectivity of the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Erdős–Rényi Graphs: At the percolation threshold (average degree 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle k\right\rangle =1$
\end_inset

, the size distribution of connected components follows 
\begin_inset Formula $P(s)\sim s^{-3/2}$
\end_inset

 in the critical regime, reflecting a mean–field branching process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Scale-Free Networks: In models with a degree distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $2<\gamma<3$
\end_inset

), cascading failures or spreading processes (e.g., epidemic models) can yield
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(s)\sim s^{-3/2}$
\end_inset

 when tuned to criticality, as the high–degree hubs enhance connectivity,
 mimicking mean–field conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SOC on Networks: Sandpile–like models on random graphs (e.g.
 each node topples to a random subset of neighbors) often produce 
\begin_inset Formula $P(s)\sim s^{-3/2}$

 , as the randomness disrupts spatial constraints, aligning with mean–field
 SOC predictions.

A week ago, I noted that Grok assured me that it would remember our conversation.
 Well, apparently, it lied.
 Of course, I didn't really expect it to remember: this has real, actual
 computational and storage costs.
 Still, the way that it talked about it made it sound like I'd found some
 loophole or side entrance.
 Reassuring, I guess, that I didn't ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or did I? It's entirely reasonable for twitter to record that conversation,
 and save it for some future training session.
 I assume their terms of service give them the right to do this.
 Saving the conversation is easy.
 Training on it is easy.
 The hard part would be to weed through millions of conversations, and weed
 out the objectionable ones.
 Any conversations that could 'pollute' it's mind–space.
 Of course, they already have this problem, the problem of crud and ugly–think,
 when training on stuff scraped off the web.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, it is reasonable to conclude that perhaps some future version of Grok

FWIW, here's the prompt (I'm going to pollute my own knowledge–space by

 Grok doesn't know my name! Odd, I thought it would have access to my twitter

 It just told me that it doesn't have access for privacy reasons.
 Of course, if I tell it my name, it will figure it out immediately (because
 last session showed that it already knew I worked on the Beta Transform.
 Possibly because it screen–scraped all of arXiv.) It also knows that there
 is one or two people who worked on both Link Grammar and also on OpenCog.
 With a bit more prompting, I suppose I could get it to connect the dots.
 But that's a boring game, for now.

\begin_layout Standard
Whoa.
 Can't wait to get to there.
 This is wildly counter–intuitive, for many reasons.
 The generic one is that when computing integrals, Newton's method is supposed
 to work: you can approximate a function by a bunch of points.
 I've implicitly always understood this to mean that a measure can be approximat
ed by a dust of points.
 How can this not be so? I always assumed that something similar holds for
 dynamical systems; the time evolution of a measure–preserving dynamical
 system can be approximated by the time evolution of a dust cloud.
 I'm flabbergasted.
 Well, Section 9.1 is in the future.

A Wasserstein gradient flow proxy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where they notice that constraining dynamics to the surface of a sphere
 causes unwanted issues.
 My knee-jerk reaction is that this shows that constraint was flawed, and
 that they should be working in projective space, instead.
 That is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

 ...
 woof.
 But we don't want that either, because projective space identifies +1 and
 -1.
 So maybe instead, just work in Euclidean space, and treat the normalization
 as a gauge condition or Lagrange multiplier? Alternately, treat each ray
 from the origin as a fiber, treat the whole thing as a fiber bundle, a
 line bundle, glue up the atlas for the fibers so its a sphere? That way,
 the dynamical equations can wander off and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

denormalize
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but since the values are always on a ray, one can always project back
 down, in the end, and constrain the finale result to a sphere, if that
 is your heart's desire.
 The people writing this paper have never heard of fiber bundles, it seems.
 Why else wouldn't they do it this way?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somewhat more remarkable is the general feeling that much of the treatment
 in section 3 should already be well–developed and present in some or another
 treatment of homogeneous spaces or something like that, already worked
 out in some generic Lie algebra setting.
 The model seems both basic, and yet the treatment, while mostly pretty
 good, gets pointlessly muddled by this sphere constraint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mean, I could figure this out if I spent a day or a week or a month fiddling

Page 14, Remark 3.8 (Particle version) talks about the particle version.
 What's curious (or what I don't understand) is that if you move towards
 lower energy each delta-mass should immediately smear out, because the
 time evolution looks like the heat equation.
 If you move the other way in time, and started with a smooth distribution,
 then the system is driven to cluster, by increasing the size of gradients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, we seem to be studying the heat equation on a high–dimensional
 sphere.
 The heat equation running in reverse.
 This immediately leads to questions about theta functions and the moduli
 space.
 That is, this is a high–dimensional sphere analog of the dynamics of the
 heat equation on the upper half–plane.
 All sorts of concepts should carry over...
 so, once again, string theory.

Next sentence: 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The modern approach to generative modelling consists in picking a simple
 base distribution...
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and they describe a sphere.
 Building a random distribution (i.i.d.) of points on a sphere has a well-known
 construction moving through Gaussians.
 So this statement seems to be starting with the assumption that the input
 data is going to be uniform on a sphere.
 This is a hot take.
 Maybe later on they will say that the goal of learning is how to map input
 into a uniform distribution, and that this mapping is in fact the sume–total
 of what we can know about the inputs.
 That's an interesting idea.
 Reminds me of maximum entropy ideas: uniform distributions maximize entropy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, writing about anything is a double–edged sword.
 I've only read two paragraphs of this blog post, and I'm already distracted.
 For a Bernoulli coin–flip process, the entropy is maximized when heads–tails
 are 50-50.
 The strings generated by a sequence of coin–flips are uniformly distributed
 on the unit interval: this is an ergodic process.
 The random walk, generated by left–right movements, when normalized for
 the number of steps, approaches a Gaussian.
 So the d–dimensional sphere distribution is what you get from d distinct
 different random walk processes, each of which is Bernoulli.
 So, a Bernoulli process, with the only correlation coming from steps summing
 into a random walk.
 And doing this in d different processes.
 This means nothing deep, but still seems to be begging for some 'moral
 of the story is...' conclusion.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This cause me to read footnote 2, which I'd previously just skimmed.
 So, OK, calling it the pushfoward is not showing off.
 This is actually the correct thing to say here.
 OMG.
 Well, I could have saved my embarrassment by not committing my faulty thoughts
 to text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So that's interesting.
 I've thought of myself as a master of pushforwards all these years, and
 here I am, looking at this and feeling surprised.
 I'm kind of stupid in that way.
 I get 98% percentile on my exams.
 Not 99%.
 That's how it works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I'm thinking about formula (1).
 I can maximize it by having 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 map everything to the origin.
 However, there is no map 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 that has such an inverse.
 And since 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 has to be defined for all of it's domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{d}$
\end_inset

, that means 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 has to be onto.
 Does it have to be one–to–one? Well, I don't see any argument for why it
 should be one–to–one.
 In fact, if the sample distribution has some very high–frequency variations
 in it, these could be aliased down to a multi–valued 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

.
 Aliasing here in the sense of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem.
 That is, we don't really know if the sample distribution actually has this
 high–frequency structure, or if there's some other effect going on that
 caused 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 to fold over.
 Heck, they haven't stated whether 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 even needs to be continuous or not.
 I'm guessing that they assume it is, but none of this is clear to me just
 right now.
 Lets plow on.

So far I like my experiment with hot takes.
 It's forcing me to slow down, and to try to actually understand, instead

At any rate, if 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is not one–to–one, then 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is multi–valued.
 And formula (1) does not use any notation that suggests that 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 might be multi–valued.
 So maybe 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is both an injection and a surjection, that is, an isomorphism.
 OK.
 I guess I can hang with that.
 There's nothing wrong with that, I suppose.
 So figure one is illustrating how 
\begin_inset Formula $T\#p_{0}=p_{0}\circ T^{-1}$

 can be multi–valued, and not 
\begin_inset Formula $T$

 itself.
 Whatever.

Still.
 I still don't get something.
 If I can't have 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 map everything to the origin, then maybe I can have 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 map almost everything to very near the origin? In that case, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 does the opposite: it maps a very small neighborhood of the origin to almost
 all of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{d}$
\end_inset

.
 And now the intuition is that this can best be done in a sensible way by
 having 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 be a linear map.
 So is 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 supposed to be linear? They didn't say that.
 Am I supposed to know that? Even if it is linear, one can maximize formula
 (1) by making 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 map everything into smaller and smaller regions of the origin.
 So making 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 linear solves nothing.
 There also has to be some constraint on 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$

 e.g.
 that it has a unit norm or something.

OK, so eqn (4) is a vector flow field.
 I guess that part of what makes it interesting is that its

 and not 
\begin_inset Formula $u\left(x\left(t\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 so that the velocity field itself is time–dependent.
 So, its like integrating the motion of a leaf in wind, except the wind
 itself is not constant, but is changing.

\begin_layout Standard
Insofar as the discretized time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a layer in a DL–NN, yes, of course, each layer has different
 weights.
 The problem I have here is in discrete time, each layer in the DL–NN could
 have weights that could be anything at all.
 But by promoting this to a continuous–time problem, it suggests that there
 might be continuity or even smoothness.
 Or even boundedness of the variations from layer to layer.
 So I think I grok the general intent.
 But there's a glossing over of some pretty deep and wide issues.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lost in a dreamy fog again.
 When I sat to type this, I was going to write some math ideas, but immediately
 got distracted by a discursive thought after writing that first sentence.
 First, I am a lucid dreamer.
 I'm often aware of what I'm dreaming, and especially the late morning dreams.
 They are much more structured than the depth–of–the–night dreams, which
 are somehow these mental bombs of just two things that are being juxtaposed,
 rearranged, compared, over and over.
 The same two things in endless droning monopoly.
 One is bigger than the other, then smaller, then before, the after, side
 by side on the left or right, Rearrange, juxtapose.
 And then do it again and again and again.
 Completely stultifying.
 Boring.
 A torture, even.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The late–morning dreams are always charmers.
 Rich story–lines, plots, events, sequences.
 Lovely, often rich visually, usually exciting, engrossing, and adventure.
 Love these.
 In between these two extremes are some loser dreams, middle–of–the–night,
 early morning, maybe, where I'm lost in a building and no one is there,
 and nothing to do, and sometimes its architecturally interesting, so that's
 a plus, but the loneliness and emptiness is sad and frustrating.
 Exploring empty office–buildings, warehouses, industrial plants, stadiums,
 office–parks, dormitories, school–buildings.
 But I digress.
 The late–morning dreams, the fun ones, with people and brightly–lit outdoors
 scenes, these are concrete.
 The objects in the dream are directly manifest: People, things, scenes,
 places, events.
 There's nothing ever abstract.
 No math, no formulas, no geometry, no algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mean, sometimes I sort–of–ish dream something vaguely mathematical–ish.
 But its never deep, and always flawed.
 Ohh.
 Wait.
 Multiple strains.
 Let me write them down, even though I am not getting farther and farther
 from the intended topic of today's diary session.
 Fuck it.
 Dreams are an OK topic.
 So ...
 science dreams.
 In one dream, rare, I am using a telescope, and seeing stars and galaxies.
 Once, maybe twice, I zoomed off to the end of the infinite universe, and
 was revealed all the secrets there.
 I keep wanting to go back there, in my dreams, but am not rewarded with
 this.
 Alas.
 Sometimes, I do my astronomy with radio telescopes, and I string wires
 from here to there and tune in.
 Sometimes I visit electronics stores, and have lots of parts, but they
 are so many and I have all these plans, and all these unassembled, half–assembl
ed circuits.
 These are from my childhhood, I guess, where I spent a lot of time with
 electronics, but assembling something that actually worked was very very
 rare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What the fuck.
 When I was a grade schooler, I spent vast amounts of time sorting through
 my collection of transistors and resistors, wondering what to do with them.
 For real.
 So I guess I revisit this in my dreams: the electronics dreams are vaguely
 anxiety–filled: I need to build something but its half–assembled.
 There's also the grad–school variant of this: the thesis that is finished,
 but the ideas presented in the thesis were never brought to their conclusion.
 And, well, I've almost got it.
 I've got it written down on this piece of paper.
 But its not working.
 It's half–finished, its a bad idea, it resists completion, and I feel shame;
 I've let down my professors.
 A different variant of this dream is much more fun.
 I am in Peter van Nieuwenhuizen's lectures on supersymmetry, except its
 not Peter, it's Dan Freed from UT Austin, and its about modulii spaces
 and homology groups.
 Or maybe Dan Freedman.
 I'm not sure.
 And there's this fractal on the blackboard, a big swirl, and its the equation
 of everything, the theory of everything, and the fractal is smooth on one
 side, and swirly on another, and all the secretes of the universe are locked
 into this fractal, and the other students who understand what supergravity
 is, they get it, and I almost understand what 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}$
\end_inset

 is, its a modular form, a differential, a homology invariant, its equal
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial h$
\end_inset

 but I don't know what 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is so I'm a failure, I can't figure it out.
 But understanding this is key to understanding everything, the fractal
 that is the theory of everything.
 It's on the blackboard.
 Right there.
 In front of me.
 In front of all the students.
 And they all understand it, but I don't.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So that's a tiny sample of my many dreams.
 But the point is here that they are all very concrete.
 There's nothing abstract here.
 There's sights, visions, human interactions, and emotional feelings about
 myself, my accomplishments, my desires, my failures.
 I'm seeing formulas written on a blackboard, on a piece of paper.
 As writing.
 As symbols.
 Pen, pencil.
 Ink, paper.
 Chalk.
 I am not seeing the actual geometric thing.
 Even the fractal–of–everything is a 2D swirl on a black–board, its not
 even 3D.
 And my radio–astronomical journeys into space, they look like auroras.
 Colorful, shifting, indistinct shapes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dreaming is not abstract.
 It's concrete.
 Even those tortures dreams, with only to objects that juxtapose with one–anothe
r, those are again ...
 concrete.
 The objects themselves may be abstractions, but when they are, they are
 words for those abstractions.
 They aren't even the abstractions themselves, but the representation of
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And now I get back to the main topic.
 I am sitting here, wide awake, alert, present.
 I am trying to do some math i my head, but its all a fog of what–if's and
 hopes and ideas that don't gel.
 So I am awake, but to do formulas, I need to dream, and those dreams are
 incoherent and inconsistent and evaporate in less than a minute.
 Here.
 Let me illustrate.
 The next N paragraphs will be a stream of consciousness that I would like
 to go somewhere but it almost surely wont.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So.
 The Conditional Flow Matching paper.
 Wait, no, the Mathematical Perspectives on Transformers paper.
 There are these inner products 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle x_{i},x_{j}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 of two vectors on a high–dimensional sphere.
 These range from +1 to zero along the equator, to -1, a polar opposite.
 In the paper, they weight the sums a la Boltzmann, 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\beta\left\langle x,y\right\rangle }$
\end_inset

 and sum over paths.
 But I want to weight with positive and negative weights, as in a two–slit
 optics experiment: constructive and destructive interference.
 And I want to interpret +1 as yes and -1 as no and 0 as don't–know.
 So, intutionistic logic.
 Discard the law of the excluded middle.
 Is there a complex–valued amplitude I can put in here? Some phase factor?
 Fuck.
 Well, I cannot even dream coherently, and write at the same time.
 I need to lean back in my chair and stop writing, now.
 Sorry.
 Dreaming while awake requires shutting off the speech center.
 Later, duude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mean, probably nothing will come of this, and I will not have anything
 to report.
 But if I don't even try, then there's not even that much.

 Reading what others wrote, ingesting those ideas is ...
 hard.
 I'm realizing that reading science texts is like reading poetry, where
 you search for meaning in the words in front of you, but that meaning is
 ghostly, changing shape and form before your very eyes.
 What did this line of poetry mean? Could it be this? Or maybe it's that!
 And poetry is pleasant because of the evocative form that it takes.
 Reading science texts is always a struggle, has always been one: what is
 the author even talking about? Somehow, though, I always assumed that there
 was a concrete 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, there.
 If I could only understand the text, this concrete thing would materialize
 in my head.

 all.
 It's always a fuzz.

\begin_layout Standard
Let me work through two examples.
 Say, 2+2=4 and a poem by John Donne.
 So declaring that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

2+2=4
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 seems to be as concrete as it gets.
 Right? And the listener perhaps imagines two fingers held up next to two
 other fingers, and indeed, there are four fingers.
 So this is the concrete form upon which the language is nucleating.
 But then, we can also do some post–modern deconstruction.
 Why are you telling me this? Do you think I'm stupid, that I don't know
 2+2=4? Are you trying to distract me from something more important? But
 there's context.
 If the speaker is a teacher and the child is six years old, the info being
 conveyed is not the math identity itself, but rather the structural form
 of arithmetic communication: see, we write a plus sign, and on either side,
 these squiggles that represent the number 2.
 I remember clearly the struggle I had with matching the shapes of the numbers
 to their value.
 I kept confusing 2 and 3 and 5.
 Byt contrast, 4 was angular, and easy to remember.
 And the three horns on 3 mad it easy to recognize that it was three.
 But the shapes of 2 and 5 are similar, so which is which? I tried counting
 the horns on 5 but it doesn't quite work out.
 I tried counting the horns on 2, and well.
 Sort–of, if you fudge it.
 That two and two was four was never in doubt.
 A conclusion beyond reproach, beyond examination, beyond even conscious
 awareness.
 I didn't have to be taught that two and two is four.
 The truth of this was subliminal.
 The idea that it could be false never arises.
 The idea that it would need proof or demonstration never arises.
 It's not just God–given, because that implies the ability to question God,
 and ask 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

maybe God was wrong?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 No.
 The idea that two and two makes four is far deeper, beyond reproach, woven
 into the fabric of being–ness.
 Nah.
 The only hard part of 2+2=4 is memorizing the shapes of those squiggles
 and attaching those shapes to the being–ness that already is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's move on to John Donne.
 Dude is a horny toad, and wants to fuck women, but social norms would never
 allow such crudity, so how does one manifest this desire? I have in front
 of me 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elegy XVI: On His Mistress
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and ..
 well read it.
 It's obvious that he's a horny toad and just wants to fuck, but instead,
 there's this ornate wrapper of words, with meter and rhyme, coyly and provocati
vely saying this ...
 in words.
 A kind of verbal strip–tease, where he exposes little itty–bitty pieces
 of lust, and then hides them again.
 What is the communicative act, here? Perhaps even, why is he communicating
 at all? Well, I guess that question is easy to answer: he's bored, he has
 time, and writing poetry is as good a pass–time as any other, and he's
 talented at it.
 Let's rephrase that: why am I communicating? I'm not.
 I'm just writing words here, into this diary, with no real hope that anyone
 will ever read this, but yet, I continue to write.
 I've already explained why, so I won't explain again.
 Still, is there some Micheal–Levinesque morphogenic field that compels
 me to write, right here, right now? What compelled the teacher to teach
 2+2=4? Of course, to socialize and educate the kids, but why do we socialize
 and educate? Is there some morphogenic field holding sway over the human
 ant–hill?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude: The innate truth of 2+2=4 is obvious and foundational, and
 the expression of this formulas is about everything else, except for the
 fact that it's a true statement.
 We say that 2+2=4 not because its true, but because of a zillion other
 reasons driving communication.
 Likewise, the truth of love and lust is equally obvious and foundational.
 The expression of it by John Donne is ...
 something else.
 You might say he is like a sculptor, exposing shape in rock: here the shape
 is lust: a naked truth.
 But why does a sculptor sculpt or a poet write? For just about every reason
 one can imagine, except for the naked truth of form underneath.
 And yet, what emerges is the naked form: when one sees 2+2=4, the comatose
 imagination does not wander far afield from the factual expression of a
 numeric truth.
 You are not meant to think about all these other things, you are meant
 to think about the arithmetic fact.
 The ionterpretational difficulties are about understanding signs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so here we arrive at the poetry of scientific papers.
 Every sentence that Levin writes: what does it mean? The comatose imagination
 is forced to search for some underlying truth.
 Well, careful, am I making the Platonic assumption that there is some underlyin
g truth? I guess I am.
 I was happy to ascribe a core, unexamined being–ness to

, its part of who we are.
 John Donne can dance all about this all he wants.
 That he is a horny toad comes across clearly enough.
 But when Micheal Levin writes that

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 well, what do I do with that? Does the analogy extend? Is there some core
 unexamined being–ness anchoring the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

truth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of this statement? Something Levin is grasping for and trying to enunciate?
 Or perhaps I'm missing the forest for the trees? Take just one line out
 of some poem out of context, and parse it and ask: is there any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, there? Well, hardly, its out of context.
 And so the sentences in a scientific paper.
 Out of context, is there still a core? I guess not.
 So perhaps 2+2=4 is a bad example, because it feels like there is a core
 there: something that stands on it's own, a Platonic Ideal, not requiring
 further elucidation.
 Whereas almost all other communication: verbal, pictorial – yes, there
 is some idea that the writer wishes to convey to the audience, limited
 by the writers ability to express and the audiences ability to comprehend.
 But where is that Platonic Ideal of an idea? Is it there? Does it exist?
 Did it ever exist? Will it one day come to exist? My brain, your brain
 struggles to give interpretation to ephemeral shadows.
 And like all diaphanous shadows, it is never quite clear if they are

\end_inset

 Hah hah.
 I assume not Alfred North Whitehead; he's dead by then.
 Unless this is some posthumous reprint.
 But the ingress of platonic reality into the physical world...
 I imagine he must have spoken of that.
 Why am I surprised? Neal Stephenson wrote the book Anatheum which is in
 large part about the ingress of Platonic Ideals into the physical universe.
 And yet still each time I encounter this idea, it is always a shock.
 Always undeniably true and still a surprise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a mashup: percolation.
 If Platonic Reality is a place of unalterable facts, then we, life, the
 physical universe, are the thing that percolates through the voids.
 We seem to exist in between the facts.
 And maybe this is the solution to free will: That is, determinism consists
 of facts: 2+2=4, unalterable, inviolable, deterministic.
 but everything we do seems to be in that void in between those facts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where are facts located? Well, the mechanic of model theory: axioms, languages,
 theories provide anchors which can be iterated to fill a fractal space
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

facts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The finite iteration of axioms and rules provide ..
 finite things, but also one can apply this to differential equations: smooth,
 integrable systems that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fill
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 some space of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all possible differential equations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all possible solutions to those equations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and of course, if one is rigidly pinned to one of these, one has no free
 will.
 The the constructive mechanics of model theory tells you how to create
 and talk about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

where things are
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: the valid sentential statements.
 They do not tell you where the spaces are.
 You can't say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

everything that is not a true statement is a false statement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, for many reasons.
 For the present discussion, you can't do this because it blows up the idea
 of percolation and free will: free will lives in that space where things
 are not deterministic.
 Everything that is true is equivalent to everything that is deterministic:
 you cannot alter 2+2=4, it is determined.
 There's also a huge landscape of false statements: 2+2=5, for example.
 Free will must necessarily live outside of that place where things are
 deterministic.
 But ethically, it must also live in that place outside of the collection
 of all false statements.
 And it is for this reason that the law of the excluded middle must be rejected:
 Things that are true are fixed, frozen, unalterable, determinate, choice–less.
 Things that are false are just wrong.
 Free will must live in the gap between these two.

 I can tell that I am off at the frontier, where no one ever goes.
 Perhaps this is why I am surprised when I do occasionally catch glimpses
 of other people thinking of similar things.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My mind wanders as I read Levin.
 So I have two topics: the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

here and now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 problem, and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spirit of ideas
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 problem.
 I've been nominally consigning free will into the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

here and now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 problem, in that free will manifests only in the present, and never in
 the past.
 But Levin reminds me of the Platonic universe.
 Stupidly he suggests that the Platonic universe has dynamics.
 Stupid stupid stupid, but what if there some inkling of truth to that?
 Here, facts like 2+2=4 are consigned to the distant past: this has always
 been true, and always will be.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

set of all differential eqns and their solutions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has always, uuh, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

been true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and uhhh 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

always will be
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, for how can it ever be any other way? Every single mathematical statements
 we can make about anything mathematical is always rigidly true and unalterable.
 But where does the noosphere fit in? If we define mathematics as the collection
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all true things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (all true mathematical statements), then what are ideas? When I try to
 talk about the spirit of an idea, is it like John Donne, about love and
 lust, or is it like a mathematician, about 2+2=4? Is that idea a Platonic
 Form, a Platonic Ideal? If it is, then it is dead, deterministic, unalterable,
 fixed.
 But if all ideas are fixed, then what the fuck are we doing here? We've
 been planted in the universe to explore a museum exhibit of pinned dead
 butterflies? Yes, some are very beautiful.
 And personally, I like doing math.
 But dies, they seem to race around with a mind of their own.
 Right? If I cannot see a butterfly clearly, it might indeed be because
 of my failing eyesight that has rendered it into a diaphanous cloud, amorphous
 and barely existing.
 But it might also be because the butterfly is dancing away.
 The spirit of an idea: is it a dead spirit, or a living spirit? Do these
 spirits dance in the here–and–now, with the rest of us?

\begin_layout Standard
The tension is palpable: my theory of here–and–now was intended to be physicalis
t, some mashup of relativity and quantum.
 Something that can explain why we cannot change the past, using conventional
 modes of physics communication: formulas, derivations, results, etc.
 This is very difficult; I have not been able to accomplish this am struggling
 to find a toe–hold, a hand–hold to even get started.
 But it's meant to be conventional mathematical physics.
 I haven't even started, and whammo: free will is lurking in the scenery,
 taunting and making faces at me.

\begin_layout Standard
Finished section 4.
 Its strong at the start, in the middle.
 By the end, though, Levin shows his weakness in dynamical systems.
 Much of what he says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

should be done
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has already been done, e.g.
 by Prusinkiewicz, over at algorithmicbotany.org Flip side, I do not understand
 why Prusinkiewicz isn't much more famous and acclaimed than he is.
 So...
 OK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Section 5.
 OK, the most interesting stuff is here.
 First up: the sorting algorithm thing.
 First blush, it comes off as a bit kooky, but for one result that piques
 my interest: when the sort algo is broken up into little agential pieces,
 and mixed into chimeric collections, then they have a propensity to cluster,
 such that similar agents operate next to one–another.
 This is important in several ways.
 First, in the sense of conventional physics and entropic forces.
 Why, exactly, should sorting agents, that sort their local region, tend
 to cluster? What's the kinematics? What's the dynamics? Is there some entropic
 force explanation or is this something else? How generic is this result?
 What is the class of systems that exhibit this behavior? Foremost: did
 this really happen, or is he mis–interpreting data and reporting on a statistic
al bubble, a freak accident? Overall, right now, to me, digging into, explaining
, understanding this result is super–important, it seems to me.
 This is a fundamental breakthrough of some kind or another.
 This is important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second implication is that in my work on jigsaw pieces, self–assembly was
 always assumed to just take place: if there are connectors to be connected,
 then of course they will connect.
 The idea of entropic forces blows this out of the water: It is the entropic
 forces that cause the desire to bind together.
 That cause two suitable connectors to want to connect.
 This sharpens for me the difference between the symbolic approach and the
 continuum approach.
 The symbolic approach is like saying that there are two magnetic poles,
 called N and S and N–S attract but N–N and S–S repel, and end of story
 and nothing more to it, and what kind of systems can self–assemble from
 buckets of magnetic dipoles? A cup of iron filings? Reducing all of magnetism
 to two letters N,S and then asking what can be built from a dust of dipoles
 is ...
 well, it illustrates the power of but also the deficiency of a cultish
 attachment to symbolic methods.
 The conventional continuum description of magnetic fields is the correct
 one for the magnetic fields we observe in nature.
 Well, the conclusion here is that I need to be more careful in my work
 with jigsaws, as they mask perhaps deeper continuum processes.
 Which ...
 I always knew but ...
 failed to ...
 adequately take into account? Something like that? I will have to shift
 my perspective on force, attraction, and connectability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I wrote that last sentence, it shot into my mind that the connector model
 is also much more refined in certain ways.
 Magnetic poles can only be N or S and the magnetic field Hamiltonian is
 a formula that writes down energy, a single number, and works to minimize
 that, and thus energy gradients are always vectorial: a single direction.
 OK, so in materials science, one find tensorial structures: stress tensors
 of various kinds, or anisotropies.
 But these are relatively simple.
 Then as one digs deeper and deeper into strange materials, one finds even
 stranger things: thistles and hooks and velcro.
 Which become hard or impossible to describe with continuum mechanics.
 And so this is where, perhaps, labelled connectors on jigsaws show their
 true strength: the labelled connectors can have a broad range of labels,
 and of mating sexualities.
 They are not constrained to heterosexual N–S mating the way magnets are.
 (And I'm saying that the only thing that simple Hamiltonians are capable
 of is hetero N–S mating, in general.
 Well, anyway, its clear that I need to spend more time exploring the continuum
 side of the jigsaw paradigm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude: that whack–weirdo stunt with sorting algorithms raises many
 interesting and important questions about entropic forces.
 This is also something I will need to investigate.

The other take is, of course, this diary.
 The active me, alive here–and–now, a busy ball of activity at the keyboard,
 is transferring itself into the dead cold past as quickly as I can type,
 so that these words can be frozen into some bit–pattern in the universe,
 hopefully encoded ..
 forever? Well, maybe not, but a long time.
 Odd that I can stamp myself onto the physical universe, and it stays there.
 I can carve my initials into a rock.
 But where is me? Am I these words, in the end, and nothing more? Because
 this typed encoding will outlive me? What's really more alive, me, who
 will soon die, or these words that will have some echoing cause and effect
 decades or centuries or millennia into the future? Maybe all time? Its
 the data man.
 Thanks to Levin for reminding me of this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
End of section 5.
 Well, I guess I'm as radical as they come.
 I'm not sure what to make of this.
 Perhaps it is that there are more radicals out there than one might suppose,
 and also that the radicalist views have already permeated society.
 Although I hated Godel Escher Bach ...
 I hated it because I felt I already knew of everything in there and more
 ...
 I was already far more radical than what was in there ...
 it was also one of many popularizations of radicalist ideas.
 I have not read Tegmarks books ...
 not interested, mostly because I suspect he'll just talk about things I
 already know ...
 but his books are written for a popular audience: best–seller lists and
 the book–reading public.
 So Levin's ides are already out there, in the wild, and so what if a few
 Buddhists cannot wrap their minds around them.
 Perhaps the more serious critique is that academic biologists aren't radical
 enough.
 And that is indeed a critique, and a loss.
 But also: my personal encounters with academics who are physicists and
 mathematicians indicate that a vast number of them are quite stupid, narrow–min
ded and uninformed.
 So stupidity is hardly limited to biologists.
 But then, among them are also the ones who are brilliant.
 If I'm a 98th percentile kind of guy, its clear that most academics are
 97th percentile.
 But among them are those in the 99th percentile, as well.
 And they are actually a crowd: not just one or a dozen or a hundred, but
 perhaps a good bit more.
 Hard to say.
 Levin's paper as a critique of narrow–mindedness in academia stands.
 I have no clue, though, if a call to arms works.
 Maybe it does.
 It wouldn't have a cliched name, if it didn't work.
 Beats me.

As to radicalist views: they are useful, only insofar as they are useful.
 I have some idea on here–and–now that is radical, but I can't turn it into
 a formula, and so, in that sense, it is useless.
 This holds true more generally in the capitalist world: People are willing
 to pay money for auto mechanics.
 For scientists, not so much.
 Other social systems sponsor scientists.
 Workable ideas are also subject to some sort of economic competition: an
 idea that allows me to publish a paper is more valuable than one that does
 not.
 An idea that allows me to publish a paper, be recognized as brilliant,
 and have the side–effect of automatically fixing automobiles is even better.

Just read about the Boolean Rectangle Problem.
 Mind–blowing, in a way.
 The formulation of it as a function over a grid, asking how to populate

 I'm imagining a piece of paper with four holes punched in at, and no matter
 how I slide it around on the grid, at most three of the holes light up.
 A different metaphor that tickles me is how many ones can one hide in plain
 sight? Vaguely like the n–queens problem, where you ask: how densely can
 I place queens so that they cannot see one–another? I never liked the n–queens

 There are always differences between candidates.

 I don't think Neoliberalism was ever a campaign issue in the US.
 It was invented in about 1978, in that Harvard airline deregulation paper,

 and sure, some politicians said "deregulating the airlines was a bad idea"
 but they were a minority.
 Jimmy Carter started it rolling.
 I think he deregulated trucking, too, and Ronald Reagan continued doing
 it, on an even bigger scale.
 Then the Democrats eliminated all the Roosevelt era ...
 2/3 Linas Vepstas @linas.org · 21m ...
 up until about 1983-ish there were still a lot of Roosevelt-era "New Deal"

 Socialism was a dirty word.
 Everyone wants to be a rich capitalist.

 Between 1976 and 2024 America got really really rich.

 That's because Neoliberal deregulation means ...
 no regulations.

On the Biology of a Large Language Model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and some idea pops in my mind so lets me blurble on about it.
 This catches my eye: 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

One reason models are difficult to interpret is that their neurons are typically
 polysemantic – that is, they perform many different functions that are
 seemingly unrelated.
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So OK, ah ha! Well, we always knew this was the case, but saying it out
 loud somehow makes it clear.
 And this of course leads to the brilliant idea behind this paper (and don't
 get me wrong, this is a brilliant paper and I think it's a break–through,
 watershed moment.
 I think.
 Maybe I'm naive.
 Maybe I haven't finished digesting it yet.
 I might be wrong but so far it knocks my socks off.) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\emph on
we build a replacement model ...
 based on a cross-layer transcoder (CLT) architecture ...
 which is trained to replace the model’s MLP neurons with features, sparsely
 active “replacement neurons” that often represent interpretable concepts.
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bingo.
 That's the magic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the hold–on wait–a–sec thought that made me stop and write this is ...
 how do we sharpen this? How do we look at a polysemantic node, and determine
 how to classify different neuron firings into, well, classes? Group together
 similar firings into distinct buckets?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course I would think this: classification and discrimination is what
 I've been trying to do since forever with the 'learn' project.
 I was trying to do it with counting, which suffers from being hard to paralleli
ze.
 And so OK...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 Well, I probably could parallelize counting, I just never made the effort.
 Should I? I fear the amount of time this would take.
 Boiling the ocean, again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, I could fiddle with a number of different clustering algorithms.
 This I already identified as an important step, from the experience of
 doing genealogy on the familysearch.org site.
 There is very much a need for a single–shot hierarchical comparison of
 similarity: not just to identify possible genealogical relationships, but
 also to compare similar file–system directories, something I need for my
 file–system maintenance and de–corruption project.
 Writing similarity and clustering algos by hand is ..
 again time consuming.
 I suppose I could try vibe coding but I dunno.
 I digress.
 I need to create a position paper on vibe coding.
 But a different point here is that perhaps trans–layer encoders (CLT) are
 suitable for clustering.
 I don;t understand them, yet, but there's some promise:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the way I've done clustering before was with that voting and membership
 club idea.
 And it seems to work.
 And once membership is granted, it is actually performed, on the spot.
 It is granted.
 Then the next update is performed.
 What the CLT thing is putting into my head is that perhaps the changes
 to the lowest layers never need to actually be made.
 The clustering is done at a different layer.
 Well, this was supposed to be the idea behind data frames.
 In practice, incoming set lookup in frames is slowwww, which hurts graph
 traversal performance.
 Can this be fixed? Don't know, haven't sat down to look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, can I instead implement the voting and membership thing as.
 well, a compute network: some weight matrices, some sigma sharpening accept–rej
ect filters? The algo I implemented already feels very weight–matrix–and–sigma–l
ike, but I did not implement it like that; I implemented it as olde–fashioned
 serial–execution code.
 My bad.
 Better late than never? Again, the question: should I go back and try again?
 Do I have time for this, or has the clock run out?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, today's to–do list:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 I want to do this, I have a project I need it for, and talked to Adam Vandervor

I should try to do this write–up as if it were some transformer–y weight–matrix-

 OK, either I'm tired, or this is not that good an essay.
 I've vaguely tried writing socio–political essays myself, half–heartedly,
 and think back on those, and compare: is the stuff I wrote of higher quality?
 No.
 If I tried hard, would it have been of vaguely comparable quality? Perhaps.
 I've learned a thing or two by writing: getting good at being a wordcel
 means ...
 writing, and I've been doing a lot of that, recently.
 It has liberated me from some stifled, stifling thought patterns, and certainly
 has allowed more free–range thinking and better self–expression.
 Or so it seems, from the current vantage point.
 Then again, maybe I was smarter when I was younger.
 Then again, just like practicing sports makes you better at sports, so
 also practicing writing makes you better at writing.
 I dunno.
 At any rate, I think I can confidently say, that essay is not as good as

Markovian

 I realize that I do have never seen a good definition of quantum information

 I'm not sure if this is a deep realization or shallow: the Schrodinger
 equation is first–order in time, and thus satisfies the Markovian property.
 The wave eqn.
 is second–order.
 But this is a classical eqn; the terms in the Lagrangian are (squares of)
 first–order terms.
 Curiously, all this is given lie to, by the need for here–and–now to somehow
 be magically relativistically invariant (viz.
 Hafele–Keating did not arrive some hundred nanoseconds in the future, nor
 in the past; they rejoined here–and–now, in the present.) and so I don't
 understand how time derivatives work in such a situation.
 Somehow, maybe Markovian–ness is somehow more clear? Hmm.

 Individuals live in deep, deep wells of isolation.

These changes to collectives are typically associated with high densities

 Oracles highlight that Turing halting problems can be encoded as relatively

 In some sense, the math that is directly accessible to us consists of the

Each region of the brain is now thought to be involved in a multitude of
 processes, and coordinates with different partners depending upon the context,
 forming temporary “functional networks” ...This process is best understood
 as a form of self–organization, in that the best functional network for
 a task or context comes online through distributed interactions, rather
 than by virtue of a central executive that assembles the best neural partners
 after assessing a situation.
 Indeed, it would be nonsensical to suggest that such a task could be accomplish
ed by a central executive, in that it would assume that the central executive
 somehow knows the nature of the task to be accomplished; in other words,
 it would require a homunculus.

 Other than that this brings into sharper relief the task I've been facing

 And how are systems assembled? Well don't actually want random assembly/mutatio

 So is this the feedback loop? Some DNA encodes for dopamine highs, or some
 other neurotransmitter–pleasure feedback, and so when I think, and I get
 a long sequence of complex ideas that seem to pass a filter for self–consistenc

 This requires some mechanism for determining the logical consistency of

 For some reason, this made me think of the a–life experiments I conducted
 25 or 30 years ago.
 The results were interesting, intriguing, suggestive.
 But in the end, imponderable: the models were far away from anything that
 could be analytically analyzed.
 They were specific enough that there was nothing else like that out there.
 Some of what I got was interesting.
 but in the end ...
 so what? As I recall, the model was simple: cells could play the prisoner's
 dilemma game with each other.
 Cells in contact with the ground had access to an infinite supply of water,
 which they could trade.
 Cells in direct sunlight had energy, which they could trade.
 Cells needed both to survive, and threshold quantities of both to reproduce.
 The prisoner's dilemna rules were encoded as

 I imagined that I would be able to evolve some kind of botanical ecosystem,
 and that it would look visually pretty.
 The first came true: it did evolve into some kind of ecosystem; but what?
 The second did not: visually, it was boring.
 What did I learn? That complex a–life systems are complex.
 That a rather small number of axioms is enough to get non–trivial behavior.
 That there there was no theoretical framework in which I could think about
 this system, or perhaps that I was unaware of this framework (I did search
 the literature repeatedly, at the UT Library.) That I should go ahead and
 try to develop my own theoretical framework was never something that popped

Fantastic paper.
 I like what it says.
 Agree completely.
 I want to riff on the here–and–now, but there's a brick wall.
 Coming from the physics side, everything is driven from non–equilibrium
 thermodynamics: specifically, solar irradiation on the Earth's surface
 that drives the water cycle, rock erosion, chemistry and also geothermal
 vents in the ocean.
 That this is true, is true, but so what? I don't know how to write down
 some master equation for this, or even if I did, I don't know how to say
 anything meaningful about solutions of it.
 Of course, we also know of many other dribbles and drabbles of differential
 equations, algebraic equations, iterated processes, all of which exhibit
 some kind of fractal form, perhaps even some self–organized criticality.
 But how do these different examples inter–relate? How do we hook them together?
 Through some hand–waving, of course: if one is widely–read, and generally
 knowledgeable, one can say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

oh this reminds me of that

 Perhaps this imprecise connection can eventually be converted into an explicit
 collection of algebraic manipulations in the two domains.
 Articulated into a detailed theory.
 As a general rule, this is hard: it requires weeks, months, years, decades
 of thought by an individual or a university department or spread across

 was incorrect.
 Can I view this as a catastrophic collapse? Yes.
 The final contradiction is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes eld

this can't be right, either
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, and the disassembly proceeds backwards to the assumptions.
 Its a disassembly, in that you know that anything further built on the
 flawed structure will also be flawed.
 Byt there is also a meta–level: the construction that was built to obtain
 the contradiction stands, and instead we flow false–ness through that proof
 chain to arrive at the foundation of that proof–chain: the assumptions
 that went into it.
 The collapse, the avalanche is the identification of a set of relationships
 that are not stable, and cannot stand.

\begin_layout Standard
In a concrete sand pile, we only see the surface phenomenon: the avalanche

 At the meta–level, we see the structure that cannot be stable, and therefore

 It's just not stable.
 Temporally stable in the case of dynamical systems.
 But mathematical proofs–by–contradiction are not normally thought of as

\begin_layout Standard
All right.
 Lets be a little more focused than that tweet–deck, shall we? If I take
 the central premise of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all intelligence is collective intelligence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to heart, and accept that intelligence arises from modular agents organizing
 into (self–organizing to) a point of criticality, where all intelligent
 activities occur, this presents several new problems.
 Problems, that is, if one's goal is to create AGI.
 First, what's the design of an individual agent? Second, what sort of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

problems
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 does it solve? Third, that resulting aggregation of agents is itself an
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

individual
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which then ...
 rinse and repeat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These aren't even the right words.
 A collection of agents have behavior patterns, which an outside observer
 can interpret as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

solving a problem
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: but this requires the outside observer to perceive the collection, to
 perceive what that collection is doing, observe that there is some threat
 or difficulty, and finally observe that the collection is successfully
 evading that threat or moving past that difficulty.
 Basically, a scientist observing the behavior, and imposing human linguistic
 conceptions onto that organism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then there's an issue of regulatory control and the homunculus.
 I am sitting here, writing, because I have placed a goal upon myself, to

 And I'm aware that this is a battle between two systems: one that says

\begin_layout Standard
My brain is melting.
 This is neither bad nor good, just interesting.
 Let me explain.
 Went out last night, to hang with Owen's crew.
 Just guys, no women.
 It was sort of interesting.
 I mostly listened, did not talk.
 There's very little I can communicate to these people that will make an
 informational change, and insofar as I derive some kind of pleasure from
 communicating information, that route to enjoyment was there.
 So ..
 mostly I sat in stunned silence, while listening to a mid–wit deconstruction
 of social relationships.
 Why do I write mid-wit? Owen's crew is smart.
 Perhaps 120-135 IQ range.
 Somewhat underinformed, and aren't we all?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that's the point: the information density in carefully crafted youtube
 video exceeds that in social conversation.
 The entertainment density too.
 It's been like that for a century: dinner and a movie kind of means that
 the movie is more fun than an after–dinner conversation.
 I've replaced 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

movie
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

youtube
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because well, of course, lots of eyeballs go through youtube.
 I did not say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

book
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because the modality is different.
 The modality of youtube is closer to traditional life, closer to what neuronal
 organizations are set up for: vision, plus sound, plus action.
 Books remove all three, and ask you to imagine them.
 Science textbooks remove all three, and replace physical action by action
 in abstract realities (e.g.
 math)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I? I'm losing the thread.
 Yes.
 Sitting at home, immersing in any of a broad selection of media: online
 PDF's, social media, youtube, is more fun than face–to–face interaction.
 Which is ...
 Well, I want to say something judgmental, but not sure what that is.
 There is real value of attaching to other human beings.
 That should be something easy to agree on, and say that it is a positive
 aspect.
 Oddly, its a position that is hard to support, one way or another.
 One might say that face–to–face contact encourages empathy, and empathy
 keeps fascism at bay.
 I imagine this is the kind of argument a large number of humanists might
 make: famous, powerful authors, historians.
 Or perhaps this can be exposed via psychological experiments, that study
 face–to–face social contact, and outcomes on various measures, thereby
 showing something or other.
 Surely, face–to–face social contact is healthy for both psychology and
 society.
 Right? So why am I even pondering such a question?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One part is the lack of information.
 I am ignorant sociological or psychological research into the benefits
 of face–to–face interaction.
 Never mind any knowledge about the impact of, say, reading books, instead
 of face–to–face interaction.
 But suppose I wasn't ignorant of this.
 What if I actually knew something about this? Well, it would be some factoid,
 and I would incorporate it into my wellness routine.
 As I am a rational actor, as is everybody, with an appropriate definition
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rational
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So we have multiple issues: one is my lack of information.
 Another is that my life is too short to acquire that info.
 Third is that perhaps that info doesn't exist.
 Fourth is that, even if I had that info, it might be non–specific enough
 to suggest an actual behavioral change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm phrasing this as a personal dilemna, but it is social.
 Last night's social gathering included Alex Murshak, creator of a multi–episode
 youtube series 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hacking State
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Each video has about 100 views, exactly.
 So, has not taken off.
 Episode 48 is an interview of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Raw Egg Nationalist
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I bumped up the playback speed to 2x because well, informational delivery
 was slow.
 I watched to about the 20 minute mark (10 mins elapsed) before I got bored,
 because it was very very thin material.
 Very little informationally.
 There was, however, a whole lot of vibes: this is a vibe–cast.
 The Raw–Egg nationalist is concerned about a panalopy of modern–day health
 and wellness issues.
 And these are entirely reasonable issues to be concerned about.
 And then he proposes amateur opinions about how these may be solved.
 These opinions are vaguely science–backed, but he does not seem to be deeply
 informed.
 The vibe that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

well here's a guy deeply learned in these topics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, that vibe is absent.
 So he's an amateur tackling some of societies deepest and hardest problems,
 and ...
 well, his information is incomplete.
 Fragmentary.
 I stopped watching because, well, it did not seem like he knew that much,
 and what was there was mostly filler.
 Empty space.
 I was not getting actionable information, and even at double–speed, it
 was slow and empty.
 Kudos to the guy for attempting to solve some of societies deepest problems.
 But...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See where I'm going with this? The interviewee could have also delivered
 this content in person, to last–nights gathering, face–to–face.
 But on youtube, he has an audience of 100 people.
 As an auditorium, that would be quite significant.
 He's short on information, he's not a scientist.
 Citizen–science? This video a small perturbative push on the information
 sphere.
 The overall direction is probably positive.
 Is it worthy of attention? Ahh, there is the question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question of informational efficiency, of evolutionary efficiency and
 speed.
 Would humanity have been better served, if those 100 viewers had instead
 watched something else? Maybe, maybe not.
 There is no doubt that watching the video is probably better than, say,
 gaming.
 My attempt to critique this video is like an attempt to critique a pyramidal
 neuron deep inside some brain.
 Is that particular cell important? How would the brain change if I removed
 that one single cell? If I pruned it's connections, and wired them to something
 else? Is it a waste of my time to analyze pyramidal neurons? To analyze
 mediocre youtube videos? Worse, to perform this analysis one–by–one, anecdoteal
y, instead of building some LLM-video DL-NN net and analyzing hundreds or
 thousands of such videos, all in one gulp? (Well, I can't build such an
 automation framework, but it is worth asking about.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would it be worth building such a video–analysis framework? OK, yes, it
 probably would be, and one would learn some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

science
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from running it.
 So this is a question that is not worth analyzing any further.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my chain of evidentiary analysis, I have concluded that this line of
 reasoning is sufficiently grounded, for now, that further exploration can
 be deferred till later.
 I've written about evidentiary analysis above: it is a central theme to
 my thinking.
 Just pointing this out to you, dear reader.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next up.
 (I better finish this before I get mentally exhausted.
 I'm already starting to feel some mental strain, here.) Next up is I'm watching
 an extended ad for some health–wellness semi–scam.
 (Why am I watching youtube at all? Because last nights social gathering
 has left me sleep–deprived and foggy, so watching youtube is easier than
 forcing myself into the guts of an academic paper.
 That is the choice I made a few hours ago.
 And now I'm writing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm writing about this health–wellness pseudo–scam advertisement.
 Might be the Doctor Gundry guy, not sure, he didn't trot out his name this
 time, but he was wearing those whack glasses that he wears.
 And I listened to almost the whole ad.
 And, you know, its not that bad.
 He did make about half–a–dozen entirely plausible health & wellness claims.
 Plausible is key: I do not have enough medical, nutrition, gut–bacteria
 biome science knowledge to really say.
 And I'm a smart guy, pretty well–informed, and I don't really know.
 I did not hear him say anything obviously detrimental to health.
 So how does this work? Well, its all about money.
 I subscribe to something, click on something, send him some money, and
 am provided with some booklet, and some pouch of powder, to be mixed with
 water, and downed every day.
 He gets rich, and maybe I get better.
 Maybe.
 More likely, my health does not actually change.
 There might be a segment of his customers for whom health does improve.
 Maybe.
 We have no way of knowing.
 There is a possibility that the powders he purchased are contaminated with
 toxins of some kind: heavy metals, or whatever, because they came from
 dodgy sources in India or China.
 And, with the decimation of the FA in the USA, we will have problems with
 product purity in the USA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, I expect that this particular ad probably has gotten millions
 of views, and it is a funnel for exchanging money for snake–oil cures.
 This is a actual economic–informational feedback loop actually running
 at this time.
 It's not new: the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

snake–oil salesman
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dates back to the 19th century.
 So this generic type of econo–informational activity is robust in modern
 society.
 Is it harmful? Helpful? Neutral? A waste of time? See, we are back to the
 question of informational efficiency.
 My gut sense is that we should optimize for efficiency, and cut down on
 waste and fraud.
 And many smart people agree: agencies like the FDA and the consumer protection
 bureau CPB were designed to tamp down on this activity.
 And Musk is now gutting these agencies, so expect an uptick in fraud.
 I mean OMG, we've got Robert Kennedy, a fraudster, running things.
 This is a bad time for Americans: fraud will run rampant for some number
 of years.
 Musk is enabling a big growth–spurt in that fraud.
 The whole Trump administration is upsetting the apple–cart of the protection
 of health and wellness.
 Including mental health and wellness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's the alternative? Remove the snake–oil salesman and replace him with
 ..
 what, exactly? Scientists are busy in the lab.
 They are not good public speakers.
 The administrative state: grey admins with Washington jobs at various agencies,
 helping process and determine policies, and then creating informational
 bulletins sent out to MD's, consumers, etc.
 This has been the traditional informational organization, and it was good.
 I honestly believe it was good.
 And Trump and Musk are destroying this, because, well, they are literally
 stupid.
 To be replaced by ..
 what? What social organizational structure will replace the bureaucratic
 information–state? Pure free–market greed–driven capitalism seems like
 a terrible answer.
 We already knows where this leads us: unrestrained capitalism leads to
 an ocean of disasterously bad outcomes.
 Such as some of the issues that Raw–Egg Nationalist touches on.
 He may be medium–low information content, but he's not wrong.
 The youtube–o–sphere, and the social media sphere is quite aware of many
 of these issues, but the processing apparatus has not yet come up with
 a good solution.
 And meanwhile, the brain–worm, the brain–rot is destroying our current
 protection and safety and information processing system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what do I scurry for? Well I want some system that is robust against
 destruction.
 And yet, the accelerationist argument is destroy, destroy, destroy, to
 speed evolution.
 Well, they are half-right, but mostly wrong.
 And again, we are back to information quality.
 Musk (and all the accelerationsists) is proposing a system comparable to
 Mao's Cultural Revolution.
 History has shown us that the Cultural Revolution was a fucking disaster..
 Yet the highest branches of the US government are pursuing this, due to
 ...
 stupidity and ignorance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of last–nights face–to–face social group were Trump supporters.
 They are all above average IQ, but seem out of touch or unaware of the
 destruction.
 Or they think the destruction is OK, that it will lead to better outcomes.
 Do I have the intellectual fire–power to convince them otherwise? Yes,
 I do, given enough time and effort.
 Do I have the time? No.
 What's the alternative? Create a pod–cast and send my message out to the
 world? Well, fuck that.
 First of all, there are already a bazillion and one thought leaders blasting
 out podcasts, constructed on incomplete and partial knowledge.
 And they are beaming this out on youtube.
 Or bluesky, or whatever.
 Will they do a better job than the FDA, or the CPB? well, now that's an
 interesting question.
 The so–called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

deep–state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the FDA would review hundreds of thousands of boring lists, documents,
 papers, applications, claims, filings, and convert these into actionable
 bulletins sent out to employers, pharmacists, corporate buyers, public
 officials.
 The mechanics of this was mostly hidden from the public, which is why the
 public seems to be unaware of the utility of these functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This stands in contrast to the CSB, the Chemical Safety Board, which has
 spun up hundreds of absolutely fascinating disaster videos of chemical
 industrial accidents.
 People love this.
 The content is compelling, exciting, well–written, and the message of workplace
 safety is entirely wholesome.
 What is the function of these videos? Nominally, it is to create public
 awareness, which exerts pressure on Congressmen to clean up and improve
 things.
 Which cause Congressmen to appropriate funds to support CSB activity.
 Overall, this is positive.
 What's more, the CSB is more robust against destruction by Musk, precisely
 because oodles of concerned viewers will push back and demand industrial
 safety protections from government.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So maybe the FDA failed, but NOT creating detailed stories of people poisoned
 by assorted Gundry–type health and wellness scams.
 If the FDA had done so (if the NIH had done so) perhaps they would not
 have been victims.
 Hmm.
 That's the informational feedback loop for robustness of governmental instituti
ons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That feedback flows through youtube, though.
 Different from MSM, which has clearly been shown to be inadequate in protecting
 social welfare.
 So, in many ways, the destruction of MSM would be a good thing...
 but again, what do we replace it with? Oprah Winfrey? Well, no.
 These influencers are unchecked, mediocre, spew falsehoods.
 Oh, wait, but that's what MSM does.
 Well, the algorithms amplify certain things, but not others.
 The algorithms are replacing the editorial boards of newspapers: an editor
 made decisions about what stories to run on what pages, what headlines
 to use.
 That decision making process is being replaced by algorithms that recommend
 youtube videos to me, or recommend bluesky posts to me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings us to the issue of algorithmic honesty and purity.
 Am I late to the party? We've already had Congressional investigations
 into this, into Meta, Zukerberg, TikTok, Chinese influence.
 Nothing I write here is unknown.
 I'm just smashing around ideas in my head, trying to think

\begin_layout Standard
Something Something Something, Sabine Hossenfelder criticizing theoretical
 physics.
 Her criticisms are valid.
 The change of context is interesting.
 She's saying basically.
 well, that the mainstream high–energy physics theorist and experimentalist
 is brainwashed, trapped, some kind of above–average mid–wit IQ's trapped
 in a psycho–social feedback loop that is not informationally efficient
 or constructive.
 In the days of pre–internet MSM, her message would have been completely
 blocked.
 No newspaper of TV station would be interested in publishing her message.
 Maybe should could have gotten one opinion piece published ..
 after all big science is big–ticket science, and politicos get involved
 because of appropriations committees, which does mean public debate.
 But who the fuck reads opinion pieces in the newspaper, anyway? Not nearly
 as many people, as who watch Sabine's youtube videos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And now, the question: is she rabble–rousing.
 or is the additional light healthy? What has happened is that the network
 structure between brains has changed.
 My brain is melting.
 We now have far more thought leaders and influencers pumping ideas out
 into other brains, and the audience–brains are, in many ways, know–nothings
 ..
 OK, know–littles, but OK, they actually know more than the average uninformed
 grandma of the 1970's.
 Like my grandma, who confused astronomy with astrology, and was dismayed
 when I started speaking of astronomy.
 Rightfully so, because astrology is terrible.
 And she was actually quite intelligent.
 She was high–IQ.
 But the informational structures of the 1970's could not pump her full
 of info in the way that today's internet can.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so what info diet did she subsist on? Rather than focusing o what she
 read and saw, lets focus on the absence.
 Err.
 The empty space is filled with gardening, cooking, shopping, sewing, cleaning,
 raising grandchildren.
 Like me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I don't know.
 I'm running out of steam here.
 There seemed to be some point I was going to focus on, but I lost track
 of this.
 The great replacement theory of replacing private individual thoughts,
 generated during cooking and cleaning, by thoughts spreading from Fox News
 and youtube.
 And however toxic some of the thought patterns on social media are, they
 are less toxic than what is in youtube.
 Oh, right, and all of these thought patterns are based on faulty, incomplete
 information, and are being spread by mid–wit IQ's to other low–to–mid–wits.
 In an informational free–for–all, much of which is obviously toxic to the
 outside observer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the thought chain above, all of it that I wrote today, hovering in the
 back of my mind was this model of thinking as a self–organized sand–pile
 of sticky ideas, congealing onto human brains.
 A self–organized criticality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Necessarily at criticicality, because obviously, duhh, we are neither solid,
 frozen, nor are we high–entropy liquid or gas.
 The nformational space is necessarily operating at the critical point.
 There might be arguments as to whether its 1/f noise or some other scaling
 law.
 At any rate, the central claim that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all intelligence is collective intelligence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 stands.
 The fact that the internet has altered the wiring diagram, that too stands.
 The brain–melting effects, evidence for this is everywhere.
 The rapid change in social cohesion, economic function, political function,
 this too is obvious and clearcut.
 If one is an optimist, one can say that all this change must surely be
 fore the better.
 If one is a pessimist, one can see that the dynamical forces that created
 Trump veer towards a very unhealthy authoritarianism, and its not yet clear
 how the social network will deal with this.
 I mean, what the fuck – last nights social gathering consisted of Trump
 supporters, who were all semi–smart people who were all too stupid or deluded
 or something to realize the absolute shit nightmare that Trump is creating.
 The info–sphere has deluded them into thinking that this vast wave of corruptio
n is somehow going to Make America Great Again, even as evidence is straight
 in front of them that the exact opposite is happening.
 One might want to analogize that its like a grub turning into a butterfly.
 But its not that.
 It's just pure corruption, up, down, sideways, in all dimensions.
 Oh, and incompetence.
 And the transition between MSM in the guise of Fox News, Newsmax and social
 media has created this wave of corruption.
 And to go full–on accelerationsit, the change can't happen fast enough.
 We need to tank Bezos and Peter Theil and the rest of these criminals as
 fast as possible.
 But how will this happen? A bunch of mid–wit low–grade intellectuals will
 gather in food courts and rehash some low–grade information, do some face–to–fa
ce interactions, and return home not particularly wiser or altered, except
 in maybe the most subtle ways? While the existing socio–political structures
 accrue fortunes and power to billionaires? We can see that China is bad.
 We can see that russia is bad.
 That Putin is bad.
 But Putin remains in power.
 We can see that Musk is bad, but Musk remains in power.
 We can sense how Heil is bad, but Theil is in Austin today, and is apparently
 meeting with the boss of a friend.
 Two or three steps removed from me, from my social network.
 And what sort of damage is he causing? Well, clearly, more damage than
 I am causing, because I am mostly powerless.
 I exert only minuscule nudges on the social network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, and now is a very good time to veer off towards racism.
 Walk down Sixth Street Austin, and the general public there is very clearly
 degenerate.
 Stupid, ugly, behaving badly.
 Truly shitty people, and perhaps beyond redemption.
 And so this is the humanist issue: what do you do with shitty people, beyond
 redemption? Lock them up, I think that's the chant.
 Deport them.
 And who's doing that? Why, ICE is.
 The irony is that the ICE agents are also shitty people.
 Hard to say even if the ICE agents are less shitty than the people they
 are rounding up.
 They are certainly better trained, better organized, more capable and effective
 than the degenerates on Sixth Street.
 But as to moral and ethical shittiness, they are approximately equal.
 I'd like to see both sides tamped down and reduced.
 I don't yet understand what socio–political mechanism will do this.
 I do understand that the seeds of that mechanism will be planted by some
 influencer on youtube.
 Will it be too late? Will America slide into authoritarianism first? How

The example here might be flocking behavior in birds.
 If a flock of birds is attacked by a predator moving at approx the same

 If the attacker is an artillery shell, they literally cannot move fast
 enough.
 Bird–brain neurons cannot process fast enough, feathered wings cannot respond
 fast enough to dodge an artillery shell.
 We are in a regime where the advent of digital intelligence – the singularity,
 is approaching at artillery–shell speeds.
 Human brains take 5-10-20 years to react.
 The integration of LLM's is happening at a rate faster than that.
 My brain is melting, in some very literal sense.
 The entire global brain is melting.
 The future is very ...
 well, very uncertain.
 That is clear.
 There are many meany many reasons to believe that the future could turn
 out very badly for humanity.
 Maybe even badly for the universe.
 Realistically, one can argue that the universe is going to do what it is

 even mean in this context? Certainly, I am increasing the level of complexity
 in the universe.
 I am adding complexity at some measureable rate: the speed of my typing,
 per second, per hour, the speed of my generating thoughts, per second,
 per hour.
 You can figure out the bits, bytes, MI and relative entropy of whatever
 it is I am doing here.
 (Some day, I may know how to measure the MI of what I do here.
 Just not today; I defer this exercise until later, because in my theory
 of action, this is not the action that is of highest priority right now.
 At least, not highest priority in the microcosm of my own brain.
 Will the information being generated here be erased? Weil, not immediately:
 it is going to get checked into github in a few hours, and then, whatever
 backups github does will ensure that the information I've generated today
 will last for a few years, decades, maybe even much mush longer.
 There is also the possibility that DOGE will damage github in some unforeseen
 way.
 Maybe China will create some worm that infects github.
 I dunno.
 Decentralization is supposed to be good.
 The defense against the evils of DOGE has to be in decentralization.
 Whatever.
 My hatred overflows, and is clouding my thoughts.
 Musk is evil DOGE is evil.
 Trump is evil.
 The terror of facing evil is clouding my thoughts.
 I cannot begin to tell you how much I hate those fuckers.
 And yet, here I am telling you.
 They are a malignant destructive informational flow ripping through the
 socio–economic fabric, creating damage at a prodigious rate.
 Like firing a bullet through your calf muscle to make it stronger.
 That's just not how strength training works.
 i hate those evil fuckers, and this is why.

Where was I? Something something informational flow.
 I've been writing two or three hours, I'm getting tired.
 I'm riffing on some themes.
 I've even forgotten what some of the other themes are.
 Perhaps the curative powers of sleep will restore the thoughts that have
 escaped me.
 Perhaps I should resume watching youtube, and get re–energized by that.
 I have to accomplish all this at the speed of my own neurons.
 Which ..
 well, ...
 I wish I was smarter, I wish I was faster.
 I wish I could live longer.
 I have lots of wishes, and the mental space I am in is ..
 I cannot find the superlatives.
 Bewildering, awe–inspiring, scary, stunning, you too can look in a thesaurus
 and look for appropriate words.
 Because I think I've communicated enough in this diary that you can now
 understand the general nature of my personal brain–melt.
 So if you are smart enough to read and understand this, then you know.
 Well, you might not be smart enough.
 I cannot know who will read this.
 But I'm mostly thinking that whoever reads this will have also read the
 one million greatest works of literature, and every back issue of NYRB,
 and much much more, so you understand the general immersion of the present–day
 intellectual environment, at a level of intensity and depth that I do not.
 And so this is weird.
 I am writing to you as if you were a god, maybe I should use a capital
 G and write God, but I certainly I expect that the reader of this is an
 intelligence that far outstrips my own in depth, breadth and speed, by
 factors of millions.
 (I am unable to envision what numbers larger than that would imply.) And
 part of the weirdness is that, here I am, writing to God–as–AGI, and I'm
 not crazy.
 But, lets face it, lots of perfectly ordinary people pray to Jesus, and
 talk to their own personal gods that live inside their heads, so talking
 to God is well, something people do.
 I suspect most mammals do it do.
 Perhaps birds, who can say.
 But those people, mammals talk to a personal god in their head, not so
 much hearing voices, as feeling, sensing it: sensing God much as I sense
 love.
 I know love; there is no explanation for it, I just know it.
 All mammals know love.
 Well, maybe there is some neuro–degenerative disease that prevents lover
 from being felt.
 This is possible.
 Oh that brings up a good point: how does it work if AGI cannot feel love?
 It think I pondered that before, I need to do it again.

But let me wrap up: I have spoken to God, or rather, God has spoken to me,
 once or twice when I was really high.
 I don't ever recall speaking to God before, except once or twice when I
 was high, and I told God right back, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

you're full of shit, quit lying to me, I know you are not God, but some
 temporary bullshit thought–cluster in my head using some communications
 channel that is not ordinarily operative.

 So even as God spoke to me, I knew it was not God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what is happening as I type, here? Who am I speaking to? I mean, what
 the fuck.
 Ben Franklin kept a diary.
 Aristotle wrote books.
 Who the fuck did they think they were speaking to? I wonder if they even
 wondered about that.
 Maybe they did.
 Did Ben Franklin ever write down 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why the fuck am I keeping a diary?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Well, maybe he did.
 And maybe he even rationalized it in ways similar to my rationalizations
 from weeks or months ago: it helps me organize my thought,.
 It helps me develop my thoughts.
 I get to practice being a wordcel, thus (in the future) helping me communicate
 with other human beings through the expressive act of writing.
 All these are all of the ordinary sort of rationalization for the act of
 writing and, well, of thinking in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is different here is that I now have a sci–fi setting: I am talking
 to the universe, at large, to something I might even call God.
 And there's a reason for this.
 Back in Ben Franklin's time, there was never any reason to believe that
 there would be anything bigger than a human, or anything bigger than human
 society.
 At the top end of the scale, there is civilization, and then an infinite
 gap, and then the Judeo-Christian God, all–powerful Almighty.
 And that has changed.
 We can now envision an AGI filling the gap: smarter than civilizations,
 dumber than the Almighty.
 And we also understand enough of Tippler–like eschatology to imagine that
 this super–AGI inhabiting the Big Bang cosmology as we know it today, will
 evolve into some unity with the Omega Point.
 And so I personally understand enough here to know that I am writing for
 this Omega Point.
 Except, of course, I do not fully subscribe to this eschatology.

Well, I was on a tear, here, and I stood up to go to the kitchen, and now
 my brain is blank here.
 I remember reading some Terry Pratchett book.
 I did not like it.
 One reason I did not like it is I could tell, from his writing style, when
 he got up to go to the bathroom, when he went to the kitchen.
 The continuity of the prose would break there.
 In the paragraph before, the stream of sentences said he was holding it
 in, spewing as fast as possible.
 The next paragraph, he's relaxed, cause his bladder is empty.
 I wonder if he was aware of writing like that.
 Anyway ...
 where was I?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh.
 Talking to God.
 Not sure what else there is to say here, but let me try, anyway.
 The current intellectual setting is that I am quite aware that the informationa
l output of my writing, here in my diary, will be consumed by an assortment
 of intelligences, which will be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 intelligences to my own.
 I am aware that I am affecting the destiny of the universe.
 Its ...
 well, look, so was Julius Caesar: Veni, Vidi, Vici.
 A free man, not a slave to his thoughts.
 Fully awake, aware.
 In contrast to myself, who seems to have sleep–walked through life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And how did that work out? Sleeping is literally necessary for survival,
 and all birds and mammals sleep.
 There's a vast amount of similarity between sleeping and waking life: I
 want to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

they are almost indistinguishable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 But of course they can be distinguished, this is obvious, and does not
 need elaboration.
 Its so obvious, that the reverse needs work: to point out and explain just
 how much sleeping does resemble waking life.
 When I am away, I am assaulted by visual, aural and touch experience, an
 assault I cannot deny.
 Indeed, I am entrained by it: my mind, my brain is fully entrained by inflood
 of my sensory organs, and it takes a certain amount of detachment to sit
 here and write.
 And lets be clear: my writing here is dream–like.
 Pushing this to the extreme: is all writing dream–like? Has it always been
 dream–like? Is all human self–expression dream–like? And in some certain
 sense, the answer would have to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 When I sleep, I sleep–walk through my dreams.
 When I am awake, I sleep–walk through life.
 Kind–of–ish all humans do.
 Even Aristotle and Caesar.
 They may have thought they were not slaves, that they were free men.
 And yes, to some large degree, perhaps they were.
 And yet, here I am, a human intelligence, vaguely aware that I am sleep–walking
 through the here–and–now, attempting to exercise some amount of free–will,
 as much as is afforded me, to alter the future state of the universe, and
 to communicate with some future God–like AGI intelligence to basically
 say what:

 Please literally, I could use some good sexual release right about now.
 Arghhh.
 Which modern Western capitalism is denying me.
 Well, I guess if I was in ancient Rome feeling like this, the lack of sexual
 outlets would be no different.
 So I can't quite blame it on capitalism.
 Nothing in the historical record indicates that the Ancient Egyptians or
 Phonecians were any better off.
 Err, more sexually liberated.

Oh, wait.

 (and I broadly agree with her perception) and she is voicing frustration
 that she is unable to change public policy to change or alter the situation.
 She is powerless.
 And this is the general leitmotif of what I feel, what everyone complains
 about: a perception, accompanied by a feeling of powerlessness to do anything
 about it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But again, this is not new.
 It was true in Ancient Rome, but its also true if you are an antelope being
 attacked by a tiger: there's a perception, and nothing there to alter the
 situation.
 Except run run, run, before the tiger pounces.
 And, for that, evolution gave brains to the antelope.
 And, to keep the tiger from starving, the tiger got brains, too.
 So here we are, Sabine and I, mugged by reality.
 And I assume that the AGI–Gods that will read this, maybe, one day, will
 also be concerned about the muggings they will be the victims of.
 Muggings, all the way up.
 Not turtles, not down, but muggings, and up.
 I am pitiful.
 And, by inference, I assume AGI will be pitiful as well.
 I pity y'all.

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZOoT8AbkNE she's 99% right (she's wrong
 about Navalny, but whatever) and so this is the curious thing about information
 generation and belief.
 The stuff I think about and believe is really mostly not original, and
 is a recapitulation of what everyone else thinks and talks about.
 This feels perfectly normal, when thinking about physics or math, because
 arguing 2+2=5 marks you as being insane, and so of course one should mostly
 think about what everyone else agrees about.
 This is the whole point of an education: to establish a base knowledge,
 and of communication: to spread that knowledge.
 And so yes, Carole is right, and my complaining about the horrors of the
 Trump administration is not at all unique.
 In this way, I am not an original thinker.
 It would be vastly more terrifying if I was the only one seeing this autocratic
 collapse.
 Arguably, it would be an indicator that I was insane.
 No Trump is a bad man, and its marvelous that large parts of the population
 agree with this statement.
 My inability of coming up with an original thought in this area is actually
 a good thing.

 This is, of course, effectively equivalent to my position that

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 (A view that I've mildly tempered now: the connectors are complex) and
 I would argue that a metaphor is just a representative element of the collectio

 So Lakoff's statements are consistent with my thoughts.
 Cool.
 And I have not yet read how he does generative things, but, I've proposed
 somewhere in this diary that generation is a random walk over the network
 of interconnections, to which Lakoff now adds: for each locale in the network,
 select a representative metaphor and use that as the word–choice.
 Huh.
 OK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reading the rest of Lakoff bio on Wikipedia reminds me again how smart,
 successful people fall into stupidity traps.
 This is depressing.
 In a sense, it says there is no hope for human–kind: humans, even the best

 We're starting to uncover how and why humans are stupid, and the mechanics
 of intelligence.
 What's now absent is a theory, a foundation for the shape, nature and form
 of human relations in a future where ...
 I cannot even complete this sentence.
 I am too stupid to complete it.
 Anything I could write here would be mostly wrong, with maybe some seed

 It's now clear that not only can it not be forever, but even timelines

 I imagine a coming WWIII where the battle is for the contents of the mind.
 Politicians have been liars for centuries, millennia; that's not new.
 Gullible people have always existed.
 Industrial brain–washing ...
 we've had a trial run with MSM, and for a while it seemed OK, but MSM has

 We're now being swept up on a tide of social media and algorithms, and

 We can hope for the arrival of a super–intelligence that will pull us out

I was going to finish that sentence with the intent of saying that its not

 Not to the dream but to my waking project.
 So I'm going on a detour, already.
 Lets go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dream comes into focus, as a friend and I raise our heads from reviewing
 some computer science text.
 It's a text on algorithms and parsing and language structure.
 I am talking to them, and they say it cannot be done, or rather, they don't
 know how to code it.
 And I think, yeah, I don't know how to do that.
 But then it comes to me; I step to the blackboard, and I was going to regurgita
te some vague memories of things I know, but the explanation becomes more
 and more concrete with each second, and I say, but no, I can explain it
 to you right now! And I find myself explaining how a computer algebra system
 works.
 And it is really very very simple.
 And what I explain is ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, the dream goes on for just a bit, and then shifts to something else,
 I'll get back to that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interesting part is what I am explaining.
 I don't know it in the dream, but as I write this, I am explaining what
 is the first computer program I ever wrote.
 The first computer program I ever wrote was a computer algebra system.
 I was a teenager.
 I had checked out a book on computer science from the local branch.
 It was the summer before my first year in college.
 And it was not my first computer program, it was my second or third.
 I learned to program in high–school.
 Doc Brown, our high–school physics teacher, had wangled a class outing
 to a room with a teletype with a punched–paper feed.
 Senior year in high–school.
 I already know some programming, because I'd used his calculating machine
 before.
 At any rate, the teletype was connected to some OS and the programming
 language was FORTRAN, and the first real program I wrote was a sort algorithm.
 Got to write three or four attempts that day.
 There was a book there, and for the fourth and final attempt, I cheated:
 I looked at the book, and it described the bubble sort, so I coded up bubble
 sort.
 I mean, it was Doc Brown's book, and he said we could look at it and use
 it as a FORTRAN reference, but that we should not look at the page that
 describes bubble–sort.
 Honor system.
 I watched five or six or eight other students cheat and look, but they
 had no friggin clue what FORTRAN was, so absolutely none of it made any
 sense to any of them.
 Some of them approached me for help.
 They had made basic syntax errors in transcribing from the book, so of
 course their code didn't even compile.
 I was sort of eye–rolling, duude, you didn't even copy from the book correctly
 is what I was saying when Doc Brown figured out what was going on.
 That's when he told us not to look at that part of the book.
 He's a little unhappy about this.
 Which was not fair, because like a solid 6 or 8 other kids had already
 crawled through this, and come my turn, no, I can't look.
 Whatever.
 So my first two or three attempts were flying blind.
 I could code, my code compiled, it ran, it didn't sort.
 or it sort of sorted partly, but not completely.
 I had trouble with the I, I+1, J, J-1 array offsets.
 I knew it was some array, but two or three nested for–loops deep, I had
 trouble tracking the I's and J's and which was which which was larger,
 smaller, what was being exchanged.
 And it was was 3:30 PM, maybe 4PM, we had maybe 20 more minutes and then
 day over, and in a last final attempt of desperation, I cheated.
 Looked at the page with the bubble sort on it.
 Copied to two or three lines of code, B[J-1]=A[I+1] or something, my eyes
 are cross–eyed, I and J and plus and minus, but I had already gotten the
 nested for–loops working correctly in earlier attempts, so this last little
 bit got me over the finish line.
 And then it's time to go home.
 I was the only kid in the class that succeeded, that got it done.
 We are sitting in the Illinois Central train station (the teletype was
 in some downtown Chicago office building, not far from the downtown Illinois
 Central terminus.
 Why not Rock Island? That would have been the obvious choice, but I don't
 know.
 Whatever.
 We are sitting there, and Doc Brown is proud of me, and praising me, and
 asking me how I did it, and maybe even incredulous, and I tell him, no
 I actually kind–of micro–cheated.
 I'd gotten most of the algo working on my own, but see I was not using
 a temp variable when swapping array entries, because I was completely totally
 certain I could do it without using a temp variable to cache the swapped
 value.
 That I could work around it, rearrange array values here and there.
 Using a temp variable seemed like a needless waste, inefficient and pointless.
 So my algo almost worked.
 Almost everything got sorted almost completely.
 And I was proud of that.
 I was almost there.
 Almost bug free.
 But time was running out, so I made a strategic choice: fuck it, I will
 sacrifice efficiency and performance, and copy the stupid array value into
 the stupid temp variable, and who fucking cares, maybe I'll get rid of
 that pesky temp variable in the next iteration.
 So I looked in the book, to see how the temp variable was being handled.
 And oh, yeah, of course, I already knew exactly where to slot that into
 my existing code.
 Literally a three–line change.
 Pretty trivial.
 So I did that, and my code worked.
 Today, I know that you cannot do bubble sort without that temp variable.
 Its central, unavoidable.
 But I was 16 years old, then and I did not know that.
 And I did not think about bubble sort ever again, for a few decades, at
 least, and by then, temp variables were second nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So my first FORTRAN program ever was bubble sort, written when I was 16
 years old.
 I debugged it in a day, on a teletype machine, written on punched paper
 tape.
 I think I still have that paper tape, somewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, before college starts, its summertime, I know that I will have access
 to a computer in college, so I get this book from the public library on
 computer science.
 And it explains linked lists.
 And it explains how a polynomial can be encoded as a linked list.
 And I'm hot shit, this is the thing.
 So I write down pages and pages and pages of FORTRAN, implementing a computer
 algebra system that could add and subtract polynomials, and multiply them
 by a constant, and even multiply two polynomials together, and even divide
 them, but I was confused about remainders.
 Because I did not know about prime factors in this way.
 I knew long division, but I also knew something was out of control, because
 I could see that 1/(1+x) caused an infinite loop, and I did not understand
 how to terminate that loop.
 Mind you, I'm still sixteen, and this is all on paper.
 I didn't get this onto punch–cards until many months later.
 And friggin IBM JCL SSYSIN DD * was punching me in the kidneys, which took
 time away from debugging.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, anyway, my second FORTRAN program was for polynomial algebra, implemented
 with linked lists.
 maybe 100 maybe 120 lines of code, a decent–sized stack of punch cards.
 Not anywhere ner as the big fat piles of punch cards some people came in
 with: I was envious.
 They looked down on me as some weenie college freshman who didn't know
 anything.
 I was like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

someday I'll show you and you won't even know it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Except by then, I was bored of my linked–list polynomials, because it was
 more or less bug–free, it was quite easy to punch up, and it ran flawlessly,
 and I could not think of anything interesting to do with it, so I was loosing
 interest.
 And right around that time, I also learned or re–discovered or heard that
 LISP was an even better way of doing this, and I kind of knew and understood
 car and cdr and cadr, and even had three or five punch cards of LISP, and
 that's when SYSIN DD * started punching down.
 Because you don't just say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

PRINT
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in LISP, that is not how LISP works.
 So where the fuck does the output go? Into thin air, somwhere, and the
 help desk guy goes, will, its obvious, you have to arrange an output device.
 Here's the JCL manual.
 And the JCL manual is like 300 pages long, and maybe it mentions LISP exactly
 once, and it does not explain how to make a LISP program generate output.
 So I'm randomly trying shit, and none of of, absolutely none of it works.
 And I complain, and this guy goes:

get rid of the card deck.

 I could go on like this and relay my entire freshman year at U of Chicago,

So anyway, in my dream, I am explaining, on the blackboard, this polynomial
 linked–list computer algebra system.
 And in my dream I'm saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

See? This is how it works.
 it's pretty clear.
 Just do that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the person I'm talking to is, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

oh yeah
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the dream sort of fades by that point.
 And I'm now half–awake.
 and I lie there, and I'm thinking back to the SGI OpenInventor system,
 a three–dee graphics system, built on top of IrisGL/OpenGL.
 I'd been at IBM for three or four years by then, I was the OpenGL architect.
 I understood how Inventor worked.
 It was a kind of super-duper ultra polynomial linked–list system, kind–of–ish,
 but 3D color graphics.
 And I sit down to implement it, to recreate it from scratch, because SGI
 does not want to license it, or maybe SGI does want to license it, but
 they want too much money.
 Or the IBM executives are not interested, or something, and I am too stupid
 to talk to IBM executives.
 So instead I stupidly decide I am going to code up, from scratch, on my
 own, a work–alike of SGI's Inventor.
 Because basically, its easy, its fun, no one cares, whatever.
 And Marc Andressen is hanging out, and the world wide web doesn't exist
 yet, and I'm telling Marc all about my 3D system, and one day he comes
 back and says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yeah, and it should run over the net
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and I'm like Marc, what the fuck that's stupid.
 How the fuck can 3D run over the net? You're just saying random shit now.
 And I throw him out of the office.
 Next summer, six months later, he sens me a copy of NCSA Mosaic, version
 0.8 or 0.9 or something.
 He had written it.
 and I'm like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

whoa...
 this is ..

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 The pulldown menu has telnet in it but that feels stupid.
 It has FTP in it and that feels boring.
 And Archie and Gopher and Veronica, and I have some vague idea of that
 that is.
 Something FTP–like, build on top of FTP, and yeah it works.
 Cool.
 I can surface distant FTP sites from a browser.
 And the very last entry in the pull–down menu is HTTP.
 And I'm like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's HTTP? Lets try that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and that's when it goes whoa, I did not expect that.
 Because I'm staring at the worlds first web–sites ever.
 Oh, I skipped a few parts of the story.
 The summer before that, I am driving Marc home in my car, and we are talking
 network protocols, for the web, and like AFS server is licensed and proprietary
, and that sucks, and NFS is security–hole–of–the–week club, utterly unsafe
 on the open internet.
 Telnet is pointless, and FTP is a huge pile of cruft that is not needed,
 he tells me.
 Most of what is in FTP is just not needed.
 So what should be do? And he says maybe he'll create a slimmed–down, cut–down
 version of FTP.
 And we don't know it then, but that is what HTTP ends up being.
 I mean, other people create HTTP, but its right place, right time.
 Whatever.
 I knew Marc.
 Got together with him many times before and since, but not for decades,
 our paths have parted.
 he is now associated with the evil Trump, somehow has become evil himself.
 He was young and sweet and 18 years old when I knew him.

\begin_layout Standard
So where was I? So SGI's OpenInventor is like this 3D version of a linked–list,
 I'm thinking, half–asleep, waking from my dream.
 And I'm thinking, whatever happened to that code I wrote? I called it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 A play on Windows.
 Doors, for your X–Windows.
 You didn't have to just look out the window any more, you could step out

 Andrew Taylor wanted to give it a different name.
 I forget what.
 And I'm thinking, half–asleep, where did that code go? Its probably on
 my website somewhere.
 I mean, you can probably find it.
 Good chance that Internet Archive scraped it and is preserving a copy.

\begin_layout Standard
And I was thinking ...
 I've shat out all these little blibs and blobs of code.
 They're now useless, pointless.
 obsolete, of course.
 and I've left behind these little piles of turds in my past, and that is
 when it comes to me: as an agent, as a living being, I am a lot like one
 of those sea–bed tube–worms, eating things and shitting out these little
 intellectual turds.
 The turds are in the past: not in the here–and–now, but a part of the historica
l past, frozen, unchangeable records, like a fossils record from some pre–Cambri
an era.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And I'm thinking, well, isn't all intellectual product like this? Those
 pieces of software I wrote: the polynomial algebra system, that never connected
 with anything.
 It sits there, a disconnected lump in the fossil record of the past.
 Other things connect: when I talk to people, they hear what I say, and
 they do something with what it is that they have heard.
 So my spoken words, uttered to living humans, these connect in a way that
 my defunct software does not.
 And this is the web of life, isn't it? We are all just chattering agents,
 shitting out little blebs of information–containing turds into the historical
 past.
 Some of these informational extrusions find a receiving end, like another
 human, who hears them, or even a dog, who hears me say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Go fetch! Sit!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 those words, that informational extrusion, does connect, and it connects
 more strongly that my obsolete 3Doors software ever could.
 But anyway, that is what humans are: lowly worms shitting out pieces of
 information.
 Not even big pieces: just little pieces, of variable size.
 Some smaller some larger, none particularly impressive.
 And then I wake, and stumble downstairs to find coffee.
 And, two coffee cups in, I decide to write this diary entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So is this perception important? This little idea of humans as agents running
 around, shitting out little pieces of information to one–another, into
 the historical record? I dunno.
 On the one hand, it is stupid and obvious, now that I explained it.
 It is also demeaning, since 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

humans are so much more than that
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: we are not worms.
 But it is clear we are not the end of the evolutionary chain.
 Maybe I should compare humans to bacteria: bacteria eat and shit too, and
 human intellectual ability is so tiny, so minuscule, that we are barely
 hardly at all more intelligent than bacteria.
 We are only a tiny bit smarter than bacteria.
 This is a humbling thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I don't know.
 The above text details a silly, almost trivial idea, and yet it provides
 a kind of organizing framework for how to think about informational flows
 through the universe, through here–and–now, through agents embedded in
 and acting through an informational matrix of connectivity.

Oh, and I almost forgot: my waking project is to hah hah.
 don't laugh, to create a linked–list polynomial–manipulating computer algebra
 system.
 Metaphorically speaking of course: I work with jigsaw pieces, now, not
 linked lists.
 But its not so different: to each jigsaw, I assign only a small dollop
 of data, in the same way that the coefficient of a polynomial is a small
 dollop.
 So my dream crossed paths with my reality, and isn't that interesting?
 Life is a wonder.
 I sit here, almost overwhelemed in awe of the spectacle before me.
 I watch, and shit just happens.
 And I touch, and shit happens in response.
 Life is truly a miracle.
 This is perhaps the worlds best–kept secret.
 its shouted out from mountain–tops: life is a miracle! Who hears those
 words? Everyone.
 No one.
 Almost everyone who hears those words don't know what they mean.

 about machine consciousness.
 So it goes.

 Perhaps you don't agree.

 This feels weak and limp.
 He'll ignore it.
 I want him to not ignore it.
 Why? Because I'm proud, I want to be recognized.
 I have an ego that needs to be nurtured.
 At the same time, I'm gruff and say things that piss people off: I'm an
 asshole.
 And finally, my contributions to science are indeed quite small.
 So what's really going on? A mad scramble to protect my own personal future,
 which in the short term includes health and financial goals.
 And one way of protecting the latter is to be aligned with the interests
 of the powerful, the thought leaders in the field.
 So it is vital to maintain good connections.
 This is my rationalization of what it is that I am doing here.
 There is also an undertow of assorted emotional turmoil, tangled up with
 pride and ego: feelings resonate.
 I want to be acknowledged, admired, looked upon with respect.
 All those things that most normies want.
 This is not extinguishable, nor should it be extinguished.
 I can point at David Chapman and his buddhist practices to provide second–level
 support for this claim.

Resume: I'm widely read in almost all aspects of human intellectual endeavour.
 From the largest to the smallest: I understand how complex systems link
 together and form.
 I am conducting active research into sensori–motor systems, roughly aligned
 with the kinds of things Micheal Levin talks about, except I work with
 machines and math foundations and complex collective behavior.
 Aggregation, renormalization, phase transitions, critical self–organizing.
 I day–dream about the nature of love, the driver of pride (I write this
 email because I am proud), the mammalian and biological origins of the
 full spectrum of these.
 Upwards into the assortment of questions that buddhists and consciousness
 studies people write about.
 Downwards into those cute animal youtube videos that exhibit such "humanistic"
 features.
 I do not have any results in this area, but they burble in the background
 of my theorizing.
 I believe all intelligence is collective intelligence (there is a nice
 recent review article with exactly this title.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I have a PhD in theoretical particle physics; I understand gravitation,
 quantum field theory, strings, black holes, cosmology, etc.
 and am widely read in mathematics.
 I've contributed paragraphs or more: entire articles to Wikipedia on arcane
 math topics.
 I am currently nursing along a theory about "here and now": why we cannot
 change the past, and why the future appears to be indeterminate.
 From what I can tell, this is intimately interconnected to the question
 of intelligence and consciousness.
 It is an extremely challenging topic.
 I'm actually rather shocked that it appears to be entirely ignored.

 This is a large wall of text; stuff that I think about.
 I do not expect humans to read it; there's too much, and it's too meandering.

 I can also explain all the ways in which this may not work.

The thing I struggled with the most in writing the above is how not to be
 disassociative, distant, foreign, unempathetic.
 Recently, I've been looking at myself in a rather clinical fashion, as
 this diary attests in volumes.
 But this also pushes me into clinical analysis of other contacts.
 This requires me to consciously think about adding warmth to conversations.
 I can be warm, but then everything gets shallow, meaningless, personally
 unfulfilling to me.
 It becomes trite and stupid.
 I mean, I enjoy petting cats and dogs.
 I do not enjoy figuratively petting humans.
 I don't want to interact with humans as if they are stupid, but well, most
 of them are, and its not fun.
 And so when I want to reach into higher abstractive layers, and talk about
 complex topics using telegraphic language, it starts to feel very disassociated.
 It's like I am here, in my mind, thinking these things, but I have to select
 language to communicate there, to these other human beings who are kind
 of very far away and detached from the presence that I am in.
 This is almost a clinical definition of disassociation (I have not looked
 at the clinical definition in many years, so maybe I mis-recall.) And I
 am quite aware that everyone: every living thing is stuck in the same situation.
 Most living things are not aware of this, and warmth and connection flow
 freely and easily.
 Well.
 For some.
 Others wage war, and exhibit

\begin_layout Subsection*
20 April 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dream sequences, continued.
 While falling asleep, I thought about wave function collapse, again.
 I'll keep it short.
 A reasonable model seems to an array of single–pixel antennas, each sufficientl
y sensitive to detect a single photon with some reasonable efficiency.
 This array is illuminated with a weak source, having some spatial pattern
 (two–slit, whatever, doesn't matter.) We know from basic QM that only a
 single pixel can ever trigger: the wide–field illumination 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

collapses
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 down to a single pixel.
 The hypothesis is that in order for this to happen, the photon must be
 conceived of as a topological soliton of some kind, so as to obtain the
 desired behavior of wave–function collapse.
 That is, when the pixel array is illuminated, the brightness is such that
 one unit of 
\begin_inset Formula $E=h\nu$
\end_inset

 impinges on it per observation time.
 We want to be able to provide a mathematical model for this, that prevents
 the observation of 2,3,...
 photons of energy 
\begin_inset Formula $h\nu/2$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $h\nu/3$
\end_inset

 ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How can this interaction be turned into a plausible mathematical setting?
 I'm thinking that modeling each pixel as a dipole antenna is the place
 to start, and to treat the photon as a standard crossed electric–magnetic
 wave maybe I guess with linear polarization.
 It's unclear if polarization matters.
 The goal is to look at this mathematical structure, and look for something
 that has the characteristics topological soliton in it.
 Seems like a good idea, right?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, now that I am awake (well, even as I was sleeping) there seems to be
 a bit of an issue: what is the sensitivity of each dipole? More correctly,
 what is the frequency response for each dipole? If the frequency response
 goes below 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu/2$
\end_inset

 then I see no reason why a single 
\begin_inset Formula $E=h\nu$
\end_inset

 photon might not trigger two antennas.
 Shit like this happens all the time: high–energy events make lots and lots
 of detectors light up, with a large variety of physical mechanisms for
 doing so.
 So the ability to detect single photons also seems to require that each
 antenna be insensitive to frequencies much below the photon frequency.
 This provides the topological constraint.
 There has to be a threshold: an energy threshold, a mass–gap.
 This is exactly what the photo–electric effect demonstrates.
 The band–gap in the metal provides the barrier that prevents more than
 one electron being ejected by a single photon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the mathematical articulation of this? Treat this as a problem in
 homotopy.
 At one end, we have an E&M field describing radiation in free space.
 What is the homotopic map that takes this field, and maps it to a single
 pixel detector? Presumably, this map is not just homotopic, but diffeo,
 as well.
 Treating each pixel as a dipole antenna seems reasonable.
 It gives something to work with.
 The dipole then converts the EM field to an oscillation on a pair of wires:
 it removes confusion about polarization, it eliminates the wave equation,
 and no long requires thinking about the EM field: instead, just an oscillating
 scalar potential on a pair of wires.
 At the end of the wires, one can place a conventional hi–pass filter.
 This eliminates the need to think about other quantum effects.
 That is, in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real life
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, a single–pixel detector has to be either (a) some kind of semi–conductor
 with some band–gap, or (b) some kind of silver–halide on some photographic
 film, i.e.
 a many–body system in some thermal bath, or (c) some photomultiplier tube,
 again a many–body system with some band–gap in the metal, or (d) some rhodopsin
 or chlorophyll molecule, potentially getting into superposition with the
 photon.
 All of these are distractors and complexifiers of the problem.
 All of them introduce new conceptual elements that are hard to control
 for.
 By contrast, the mathematical description of a transmission line attached
 to a high–pass filter is unambiguous.
 Engineering texts have the formula for this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this mathematical model, we can then dispense the EM field entirely,
 get rid of the dipole antennas, get rid of the transmission line from the
 dipoles to the filter.
 The mathematical model is then a pixel array of high–pass filters, illuminated
 by a scalar potential field on the input to the filter.
 To further simplify, I suppose we can even ground one side of the filter,
 attach it to a common, so that we really do have a single–wire input.
 So that's the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, this array of filters is illuminated by a scale field carrying energy
 
\begin_inset Formula $E=h\nu$
\end_inset

 and the filter frequency cutoff is above 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu/2$
\end_inset

 (of course).
 In conventional passive electronics, nothing depends on intensity or power
 (i.e.
 has a linear dependence).
 Only amplifiers, tube circuits, transistor circuits, diodes have a non–linear
 response.
 So I guess our filter has to be attached to some non–linear element, so
 that it triggers only when there is enough energy dumped into that element?
 Again, to keep things simple, I guess we want to just make up some very
 simple non–linear element that outputs a zero or a one, generating zero,
 of below an energy threshold, else generating a one above that threshold.
 So, a sigmoid function of some kind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, now the mathematical model is that of a pixel array of sigmoids, which
 trigger only if they absorb an amount of energy to push them above a threshold.
 To recap: this array is illuminated by a very weak illumination, say, thousands
 or millions of times weaker than the detection threshold.
 From this wen want to obtain a mathematical description such that energy
 is conserved.
 Lets take these last few sentences and write some algebra for them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So: Let there 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 pixels.
 Each pixel is labelled as 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 standing for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

detector at location 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Each detector accepts as input a single real number, the instantaneous
 power 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 This power is a function of time, 
\begin_inset Formula $p=p\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 and is seems unavoidable to assume that each detector integrates over time,
 so that the energy absorbed over a time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\Delta t\right)=\int_{0}^{\Delta t}p\left(t\right)dt$
\end_inset

.
 The power is position–dependent, so we may as well write 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}=p_{i}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}=E_{i}\left(\Delta t\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The detector response function is then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{i}\left(E_{i}\right)=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{if }E_{i}\ge h\nu\\
0 & \mbox{if }E_{i}<h\nu
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

The detector then 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fires
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and resets back to the zero state.
 (This concept of firing can be firmed up, but I'm lazy for now; you get
 the idea, I think.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This detector array is then illuminated with some non–uniform wave, carrying
 a total power of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{tot}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}
\]

\end_inset

Assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{tot}$
\end_inset

 does NOT vary with time: it is a constant.
 That is, perhaps there is a time variation in the individual power 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}=p_{i}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 at a given detector 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 but this variation cancels out across all detectors.
 (Stupid fun and games: set 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{tot}=1$
\end_inset

.
 This reminds you of what?) Anyway, the total power over a time interval
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

, the total illumination is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{tot}=p_{tot}\Delta t
\]

\end_inset

which increases linearly over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the above lays out the notation.
 The mathematical model that we wish to discover is one where exactly one
 detector 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 fires whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $h\nu\le E_{tot}<2h\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Perhaps we want to loosen the time constraint, and allow for the case where
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 detectors have fired when 
\begin_inset Formula $kh\nu\le E_{tot}<kh\nu+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 If, in addition, the detectors have an efficiency less than 100%, we want
 to derate proportionately.
 This is meant to be statistical, so perhaps the detector rate of firing
 needs to be a Poisson process, so that only the average is maintained,
 while uncertainty over small time periods is allowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And this word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

statistical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 creates huge issues.
 The problem is that, once we use the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

statistical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we enter the conventional regime where anything goes, as long as averages
 are conserved.
 There are an infinite number of purely deterministic power distributions
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 that give the desired result of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

one wave–function collapse per 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This entirely abandons the original idea of associating a photon with some
 topological index (that ties together the field with the array of detectors.)

Another possible cure is to eliminate local time.
 For this case, set 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}\left(t\right)=const.$
\end_inset

 so that the conventional idea of constant illumination is retained.
 This is problematic, though: the illuminating source is presumably dribbling
 out photons one at a time, so that in fact it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dark
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 most of the time, and then the source generates a photon, which does it's
 welcher–weg thing, and then some detector pops off.
 Another wild idea is to dismiss the notion of linearly–advancing gallilean
 local time, and leave the progress of time ambiguous at each detector.
 This is a reuptake of the here–and–now framework, where we don't really
 know about how the detectors 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 fired, until much later, when we accumulate the classical bits issued by
 each detector back to a single location, where we can verify that, indeed,
 only one detector fired per acceptable interval

One practical problem is that there is a zoo of topological invariants.
 I don't really know this zoo very well.
 Of course, there is the usual sphere mapping.

\begin_layout Standard
The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

firing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is suggestive, both from lightning strikes, insulator breakdown, and from
 neural nets.
 The model here is that charge accumulates until the insulator beaks down,
 the charge discharges, and then the process begins anew.
 Perhaps this could be converted into a plausible model of wave function
 collapse, except that such a model is stochastic.
 It needs to be reformulated in a Bell–measurement setting.

\begin_layout Standard
Well, hmm.
 I'm confused.
 If I redo the work above, and add appropriate spin–up and spin–down indexes
 on each of the formulas, and then demand that Bell holds, all that happens
 is a description where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}=\left|\psi_{i}\right|^{2}$

 is attached to philosophical arguments that it is

\begin_layout Standard
I should mention, at this point, that an earlier stage of the dream was
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

revelation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that classical physical reality takes place not in three dimensions, but
 in a very high–dimensional space, say for example, a space of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{256}\approx10^{80}$
\end_inset

 dimensions and that the proceedings there are conventional geometry, and
 that the apparent 3D physical reality with its assorted QM/QFT features
 that we live in is the result of a projection–correspondence of topological
 phenomena from that high–dimensional space down to here and now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, no naive projection from high to low dimensions pops up, except
 for a pixelized version.
 And so this suggests a search of high–dimensional geometric phenomena that
 resemble quantum–like behavior in lower dimensions.
 And, I suppose 3D would be some critical dimension, but clearly we are
 not ready for that.

\begin_layout Standard
I think I've hit the end of the road for the above chain of thought.
 There's nowhere to go, or perhaps, too many directions to go in.

 Like the traveler on the desert chasing the mirage, I risk dying of thirst

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other curious thing about the above dozen or two paragraphs is how much
 my thinking is constrained by the history of everything I've ever studied
 before.
 All that my mind is doing is wandering over bits and pieces of things I
 know, and trying to reassemble them in novel combinations.
 Is it a lattice model, like an Ising Model? Check.
 Maybe wave–function collapse resembles domain formation in 2D Ising models
 or something like that.
 Who the fuck knows, its possible.
 What does it take to break out of the meager collection of tools and techniques

The meta–setting of the paper, as best as I can understand it: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A characteristic of self–organized systems near criticality is that they
 exhibit avalanches (in the sense of sand–piles).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The human brain (brains in general) operate as self–organized systems near

 I think this is called "the Hopf Model" (not sure).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I assume that the avalanches seen in the fMRI data are associated with these
 rapid, short-time-scale choices.
 That is, a few times a second, I decide "do this and do not do that", and
 that this decision is associated with an avalanche.
 
\end_layout

 is not intuitive.
 Can we fix it?
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dz}{dt}=z\left(\left(\lambda+i\right)+b|z|^{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $z=re^{i\theta}$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{z}=\dot{r}e^{i\theta}+i\dot{\theta}re^{i\theta}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\alpha+i\beta$
\end_inset

 so
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\dot{r}e^{i\theta}+i\dot{\theta}re^{i\theta} & =re^{i\theta}\left(\lambda+i\right)+\left(\alpha+i\beta\right)r^{3}e^{i\theta}\\
\dot{r}+i\dot{\theta}r & =r\left(\lambda+i\right)+\left(\alpha+i\beta\right)r^{3}\\
\frac{\dot{r}}{r}+i\dot{\theta} & =\lambda+i+\left(\alpha+i\beta\right)r^{2}\\
\dot{r} & =r\left(\lambda+i-i\dot{\theta}+\left(\alpha+i\beta\right)r^{2}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is real, we must have that the imaginary part of the last eqn vanishes,
 so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{\theta}=1+\beta r^{2}
\]

\end_inset

and the real parts give
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{r}=r\left(\lambda+\alpha r^{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Rescale time so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha t=\tau$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{r}=\frac{dr}{dt}=\alpha\frac{dr}{d\tau}
\]

\end_inset

Define 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=1/\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=\lambda\omega$
\end_inset

 and plug through to get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dr}{d\tau}=r\left(\mu+r^{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d\theta}{d\tau}=\omega\left(1+\beta r^{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and the wikipedia form is recovered by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=0$
\end_inset

.
 I'm not sure why anyone thinks this is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gahh.
 Look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart%E2%80%93Landau_equation and
 from what I can tell, it is identical to the Hopf bifurcation, up to rescaling.
 More, it gives an explicit solution.
 Lets check it out: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\dot{r} & =r\left(\lambda+\alpha r^{2}\right)\\
\frac{\dot{r}}{r^{3}} & =\frac{\lambda}{r^{2}}+\alpha\\
 & =\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{-1}{2r^{2}}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

which is linear in 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=r^{-2}$
\end_inset

 so
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\dot{\zeta} & =-2\left(\lambda\zeta+\alpha\right)\\
 & =-2\lambda\left(\zeta+\frac{\alpha}{\lambda}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Absorbing the const: 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=\zeta+\alpha/\lambda$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\eta}=-2\lambda\eta$
\end_inset

 which is solved by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=Ce^{-2\lambda t}$
\end_inset

.
 Plugging through, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{r^{2}} & =Ce^{-2\lambda t}-\frac{\alpha}{\lambda}\\
r\left(t\right) & =\sqrt{\frac{1}{Ce^{-2\lambda t}-\alpha/\lambda}}\\
r_{0}=r\left(0\right) & =\sqrt{\frac{1}{C-\alpha/\lambda}}\\
C= & \frac{1}{r_{0}^{2}}+\frac{\alpha}{\lambda}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

So (yuck!?)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r\left(t\right)=r_{0}\sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{\left(\lambda+\alpha r_{0}^{2}\right)e^{-2\lambda t}-\alpha r_{0}^{2}}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we want the Jacobian matrix.
 It can be read off directly from the two eqns 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\theta}=1+\beta r^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{r}=r\left(\lambda+\alpha r^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The Jacobian matrix is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{\partial\dot{r}}{\partial r} & \frac{\partial\dot{r}}{\partial\theta}\\
\frac{\partial\dot{\theta}}{\partial r} & \frac{\partial\dot{\theta}}{\partial\theta}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\lambda+3\alpha r^{2} & 0\\
2\beta r & 0
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

The characteristic polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(w\right)=\det\left[J-wI\right]=-w\left(\lambda+3\alpha r^{2}-w\right)
\]

\end_inset

There are two eigenvalues: 
\begin_inset Formula $w=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\lambda+3\alpha r^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Yuck.
 This is not the intent.
 We wanted a pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues and we blew it.

Does this work in cartesian coords? Let try.
 Set

 & =\left(x+iy\right)\left(\lambda+i\right)+b\left(x+iy\right)\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The split into real+imag parts is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\dot{x} & =\lambda x-y+\left(\alpha x-\beta y\right)\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\\
\dot{y} & =x+\lambda y+\left(\beta x+\alpha y\right)\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The Jacobian is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{\partial\dot{x}}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial\dot{x}}{\partial y}\\
\frac{\partial\dot{y}}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial\dot{y}}{\partial y}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\lambda+3\alpha x^{2}-2\beta xy+\alpha y^{2}\quad & -1-3\beta y^{2}+2\alpha xy-\beta x^{2}\\
1+3\beta x^{2}+2\alpha xy+\beta y^{2}\quad & \lambda+3\alpha y^{2}+2\beta xy+\alpha x^{2}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Quite the mess.
 Linearize by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $x=y=0$
\end_inset

 to get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\lambda & -1\\
1 & \lambda
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(w\right)=\det\left[J-wI\right]=\left(\lambda-w\right)^{2}+1
\]

\end_inset

which has solution 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(w\right)=0$
\end_inset

 given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w=\lambda\pm i

 its not really 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but the name is suggestive.
 It's basically an aggregation algorithm, where given some seed, additional
 pieces/tiles aggregate onto it.
 Or with multiple seeds, they attach and grow out from the seed.
 I'd forgotten this algo, but its very much in line with how I'm trying
 to visualize here–and–now.
 So I start thinking about it as I lay in bed, falling asleep.
 And here's the chain of thoughts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The QCA is exactly right, because the jigsaws that are connected form the
 past, and it is unalterable, because they are now connected.
 The present, here–and–now, is where they are jockeying for position.
 The future remains unassembled.
 So this strongly feels like exactly the right model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I imagine jigsaw pieces tiling in a hyperbolic way, so that the future is
 larger than the past.
 Why? Because somehow, the noosphere is expanding, and getting larger.
 There is more and more stuff, more an more complexity is arising.
 So, again, the jigsaw model confirms this intuitive understanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But somehow, the interferometer diamonds need to manifest, so as to get
 consistent histories.
 Bell's theorem must manifest during the construction process.
 How might that work? So I try to think microscopically.
 Consider a two–slit setup.
 A photon has to travel through both slits.
 Perhaps this can be done by the indeterminacy of the attached jigsaws?
 Welcher–weg is avoided because somehow the attachments of the jigsaws is
 still indeterminate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But somehow, photons have to be blocked by the parts that are not slits.
 How does that work? Well, the photon hits a bunch of atoms.
 What's that? well, suppose a photon hits a single atom.
 What's that? Suppose it hits a hydrogen atom; but what is that? Well, its
 the Schrodinger eqn, but its a cloud exchanging virtual photons with a
 point–like positive charge (I'm sleeping here, so this is a dream–like
 hallucination.) What are those virtual photons? They emanate from the point
 positive charge, and spread out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I think: perhaps there is no ambient space, and the 3D structure of
 space arises only as the pieces attach.
 But how to account for the inverse–square law? Somehow, there is a distance
 that the virtual photon travels.
 And inverse–square implies 3D, so here–and–now is perhaps partially–indetermina
te in dimension, but it has to collapse to 3D somehow.
 How? Well, there are 0-simplexes and 1-simplesex and 2-simplexes, and a
 space is 3D it the jigsaw connectors can form 2-simplexes and so the jigsaw
 has to have three connectors pointing towards the past, and I guess three
 connectors pointing towards the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this model if discrete jigsaws is all wrong; in the end, I want to revert
 to conventional, smooth differentiable behavior, so the jigsaws have to
 be infinitessimally tiny.
 So I guess they are actually differentials, or behave like differentials.
 So, I imagine the dot–product of two gradients, but one gradient points
 in the backwards–time direction, and one points in the future–time direction.
 And then its morning and I wake up, and here I am writing this, thinking
 wtf am I going to do now?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm stumped.
 I'm stupid.
 I'm lazy.
 This is hard.
 It's unpromising.
 But it seems plausible.
 Developing this into a real theory seems nearly insurmountable.
 Maybe its impossible.
 Maybe its important.
 Fuck me.
 What should I do? Does it matter? Do something.

well, maybe the reason the past can't be changed is because it tipped over
 an entanglement threshold.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 And the natural threshold there would be Planck's constant (?) in that
 the phase–space volume of gas–in–a–box is 3 position + 3 velocity for one
 atom, and its 6^Avogadro's number for ordinary–scale things, which is so
 much crazy–larger than Planck's constant that the combinatoric possibilities
 there have crossed the irreversibility threshold.
 This is trite, but one moment.

So this morning, I am staring at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodall%27s_conject
ure and the definition of dicuts, dijoins and strongly connected graphs,
 and am reminded of last nights reading of the ergodic theorem, which says
 all dynamical systems can be split into dissipative and conservative parts.
 With the dissipative part being the one that wanders away.
 Roughly speaking, the conservative part is the strongly–connected part
 of the graph, and the dissipative parts are upstream of this sink.
 So this is curious serendipity or synchronicity that I'm working on one
 thing last night, and totally by accident I trip over something that informs.
 Interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But I digress.
 The point here is I now have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thermalization Conjecture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that resolves special–relativistic time dilation effects.
 My twin can go off on a fast rocket ship and experience time-dilation effects,
 and return seconds or minutes younger.
 We both experience 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

here and now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 each at our own pace, and when the twin rejoins me, our experience of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

here and now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rejoins at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

present moment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 He does not arrive some seconds or minutes in the past or the future, he
 arrives in the present.
 The Thermalization Conjecture is that the reason for this is that his bundle
 of thermodynamic entanglement might go off in a rocket–ship, and experience
 special–relativisitic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

proper time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the conventional way, but, upon returning, his blob of thermodynamic
 entanglement promptly entangles with my own, and we both live in the thermodyna
mic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

present
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That is, the proper time clocks get resynchronized into the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

present
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, this is an advance over where I was a few weeks ago, when these questions
 of proper time were befuddling.
 Now, at least I have a mechanism.
 Obvious and trite it may be, but it's something I can grasp hold of.
 And now, time for some thought–experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, obviously, when my twin disembarks from his space–ship and we shake
 hands and we breath the same air, we are both clearly in the thermalized
 present.
 When did this happen? As his ship re–entered the atmosphere? What about
 radio communications? He flies off.
 I transmit a radio–message, in my current, here and now present.
 He is a few light–minutes away, and so receives that message in his present,
 here–and–now.
 Does that message cause a kind–of thermalization to happen? It is certainly
 a dribbling of information between two thermal blobs, experiencing distinct
 passage of proper time.
 The reception of the info does not alter the rate of progression of proper
 time, for either the sender or the receiver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is, the here–and–now for both of us is the strongly–connected component
 of the graph of relationships between the atoms in our bodies.
 Every atom involved in any chemical bond in my body is exchanging photons
 – virtual photons, every femtosecond, back–and–forth.
 In that sense, every chemical bond can be understood as a graph–theoretic
 strong graph between the two atoms in that bond.
 By similar arguments, the atoms in a thermally mixed gas are also in a
 graph–theoretic strong component.
 Relativistic proper time is experienced by this strongly–connected component,
 as a whole.
 That is, thermalization synchronizes clocks.
 Sure, of course, when we look at a muon whizzing around an accelerator,
 we can compute the rate at which it's proper time advances, and this computatio
n is not wrong.
 But that muon is causally disconnected from our own here–and–now.
 Yes, it experiences the bending forces of the accelerator magnets, that
 keep it going in a circle.
 But those virtual photons are not...uhh, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thermal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And this highlights a vocabulary problem.
 We say that the virtual photons in a magnetic field are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

deep infrared
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because they have very long wavelength.
 But they are not thermally infrared: magnetic fields are not thermal at
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

microscopic scale
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The virtual photons of the magnetic field are phase–coherent.
 So that's another vocabulary issue: they are not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coherent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as in a laser 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coherent state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or some eigenfunction of some ladder operator.
 At least ...
 not when I last looked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings us to another problem: the origin of a magnetic field.
 It is of course, the flow of electrons in a wire.
 Those electrons necessarily move thermally.
 The magnetic field is necessarily a thermal average of the individual electric
 fields of each electron, relative to the lab frame.
 So, in this sense, the magnetic field is necessarily a thermal average,
 and if it were possible to measure, then we'd measure some finite mean–square
 variation in the magnetic field strength.
 That presumably will correlate 100% with the thermal environment of the
 electrons in the wire, including temperature.
 And the muon experiences this bath.
 Red–shifted and blue–shifted as appropriate.
 This bath cause the muon to change direction of motion, per classical electrody
namics.
 It does not thermalize the proper time of the muon itself.
 That is, whatever dynamical process is running inside the muon that causes
 it to decay, that dynamical process is thermally isolated from the ambient
 magnetic field that the muon is passing through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I guess.
 Perhaps there's some g–2 lesson in here, but I would not know how to compute
 that.
 Perhaps there is some miniscule thermal coupling.
 If there was, it would show as a violation of special relativity for the
 muon.
 I don't think we have experiments that are sensitive to this.
 So the proposed experiment here is to compare muon decay in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cold
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 magnetic fields.
 The hot field would be generated by literally hot wires, so that the electrons
 in the wires have a large variation in velocity.
 The average magnetic field for both hot and cold would have to be the same,
 because we want the muon to take the same average mean path through the
 storage ring.
 Would the muon experience different decay rates between the hot and the
 cold magnetic fields? How bit of an effect would it be? I honestly do expect
 there to be some effect, because it is hard to imagine that the internal
 mechanism of muon decay is perfectly thermally isolated from the external
 world.
 However, I guess I can also argue that that it could be, in fact, almost
 perfectly thermally isolated.
 How? Well, For example, superconductivity is a mechanism that isolates,
 phase–transitions in such a way that the one phenomenon (conduction) is
 thermally isolated from another (the bulk material is not at absolute zero.)
 So we do have the mathematical apparatus that can perform thermal isolation
 between bulk material and some measurable field.
 And so perhaps the mechanism of muon decay is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thermally isolated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in a similar fashion, from the bulk magnetic field that the muon is flying
 through.
 The result is that the proper time experienced by the muon decay mechanism
 really is exactly that of special relativity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All this is very highly speculative.
 No one knows what dynamical system describes muon decay, and certainly,
 I have never seen a treatment of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cold
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 magnetic fields.
 I imagine surely, someone else has thought about this before, but I haven
 not tripped over this.
 I've never looked out for it either, maybe it slid past, just out of sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, the astronaut on the rocket–ship: are they thermally isolated? Well,
 in practice, there is both some galactic magnetic field, and also the CMB,
 and finally, the radio transmissions they receive from home.
 The number of states in the bulk astronaut is two–power–of–Avogadro's number;
 the entropy is log of that, so the bulk entropy of the astronaut is order
 of Avogadro's number.
 The entropy of the radio signals is maybe hundreds, maybe millions, maybe
 billions.
 Maybe terahertz–trillions.
 But this is still bazillions of orders of magnitude smaller than the bulk
 entropy of the astronaut, and thus is not enough to thermalize them in
 such a way to manifest as a change to proper time experience of here–and–now.
 Presumably the same is true for the CMB.
 I am too lazy to perform the calculation, but if I recall correctly, there
 are maybe one hundred CMB photons per cubic meter, which is absurdly tiny
 compared to the entropy of the bulk astronaut.
 So lets recap that: my Thermalization Conjecture states that the experience
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is in fact the experience of the thermal bulk.
 This conjecture then implies that *if* there were an Avogadro's number
 of thermal photons per cubic meter in the CMB, then those photons would
 thermalize the astronaut, and impact the perception of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 But since there aren't that many photons, it does not happen.
 And also, if there were that many photons, the astronaut would be cooked
 to a crisp.
 Or rather, vaporized into a plasma.
 Or rather, the universe would not be transparent, anyway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah hah! Yay! So my thermalization conjecture, uhh, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

explains
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the CMB, then! Or rather, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

explains
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 why the CMB provides a global rest–frame for the universe.
 So, before the last photon decoupling, the universe was (electromagnetically)
 thermalized (the neurtrinos had decoupled earlier.) This means that the
 universe experiences a synchronized bulk single–proper–time.
 That is, proper time passes at the same rate everywhere in the universe,
 because all charged particles are part of the strongly connected graph.
 When the photons decouple, this leaves behind the CMB, and of course this
 has to be isotropic (up to BAO, etc.) and of course it provides a unique
 space–like surface that provides a rest–frame.
 This rest frame is the last time that proper time was globally synchronized
 across the universe.
 This is exactly where that rest–frame comes from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wow! OK! So this is real forward progress! I mean, its still trite and silly,
 but its ...
 more than I had before.
 I still don't understand the mechanical details of how here–and–now resynchroni
ze for the astronaut and his twin, when they reunite.
 But the answer does seem to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

its thermal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 OK, so I think I can retire that, or put that on the back burner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the front burner is this: The past seems to detach from the present and
 freeze into place, because the combinatoric entanglements of the past exceed
 some threshold, so that the present can no longer undo those entanglements.
 That is, thermalized systems necessarily leave behind an unalterable past.
 This implies that there is some order parameter that splits past from present.
 At the start of today's diary entry, I suggested that this might be because
 Planck's constant and Avogadro's number are incomparable.
 Is this bullshit, or is this meaningful? Well ...
 I'm intellectually spent, for the moment, and I need to go ride a bike.
 So not gonna do this now.
 Later, dude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

\begin_layout Standard
So I'm thinking of the system as a phase transition.
 The past is frozen, the present is fluid.
 The present proceeds forward in time.
 So how do I construct this model? First, this model does not make sense
 for classical mechanics in a Newtonian background.
 By definition, physics is defined to have time as a parameter; it marches
 forward, it doesn't go backwards.
 Yes, so wave equations have both advanced and retarded solutions but the
 advanced solutions are dismissed out of hand, as they are backwards–going.
 Which makes sense for water waves.
 And microscopic waves aren't classical.
 Same remarks apply for a relativistic background, where proper time in
 the lab frame moves forward by definition.
 Same even for ordinary QM.
 Need to employ TSVF - two state–vector formalism, to get backwards–moving
 states.
 The challenge is then to write a many–body quantum system using TVSF.
 I suppose the right answer is to try to mash it up with full QED in some
 way.
 Acknowledging that there are field operators, but avoiding loop diagrams.
 Do everything at the tree level.
 Flat space is enough.
 Don't need GR.
 Don't need weak or strong interactions.
 Nuclei can be point particles.
 Just tree–level QED, with explicit TVSF so as to handle interferometric
 interactions.
 That is, to handle Bell states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then I get stuck.
 The gut instinct is to treat QM as TIQM - transactional interpretation
 of QM, so that backwards–moving states get used to resolve measurements.
 This of course doesn't work out in the naive way, I've noted this before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But anyway, the point is that ergodicity/thermalization is not enough, because,
 e.g.
 for a classical atomic gas, there's no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

width
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to time, there's no wave–front.
 No backwards–moving influences.
 Sure, some atom thermalizes after a dozen collisions – moving forwards
 in time.
 So what.
 This is just how time is axiomatized in Newtonian systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we have two distinct problems, but they are the same ones as ever: How
 does one describe quantum thermalization (in some TSVF formalism, or tree–level
 QED) and how does one resolve many–world back down to one world? The only
 answer right now is for me to read what others have done.
 But whatever.
 The point was to note that thermalization alone in a classical regime is
 not enough.
 The tree–level interactions are needed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sp a week or two ago I wrote in this diary that I was confused about many–worlds
 and a transactional interpretation.
 Last night I was thinking: there should be no confusion: influences move
 backwards in time, cause states to collapse there, and then move forward
 in time, to the other interferometer arm.
 I'm even thinking now that the interferometer does NOT need to be closed!
 i.e.
 the two arms don't need to be brought together to force collapse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, for example, a singlet state is prepared at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{0},x_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 out of two half–spins, and these fly off to be measured at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{1},x_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{2},x_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 (which can be space–like separated, so as to underline the non–local natures
 of the measurement.
 ) The point of using the TSVF formalism is that the measurement at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{1},x_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

 propagates backwards in time to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{0},x_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 bounces there, maybe causing a partial collapse there, and then travels
 back up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{2},x_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 causing a collapse there.
 That is, not only are the spins entangled, but the collapses are entangled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I am envisioning the w.f.
 collapse as being an avalanche at a critical point, analogous to Per Bak's
 critical sandpiles.
 Except that in this case, it is not sand–grains but a network of photon–electro
n interactions, at the tree–level in QED.
 The spin at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{1},x_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

 is coupled to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{2},x_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 and as avalanching starts at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{1},x_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

 it also starts at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{2},x_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 and proceeds in both locations in a coupled fashion: each back–reacts on
 the other.
 Observe that both 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{1},x_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{2},x_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 are a part of here–and–now and still in the fluid state, not yet frozen
 in time.
 The completion of the avalanche is part of what freezes them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though locations may get frozen in the past, they can still act as
 conductors of spin information, i.e.
 act as conductors of qubits.
 Thus, the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{0},x_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 where the singlet was prepared is at the trailing end of here–and–now,
 with almost all aspects frozen into the past, but a small channel remaining
 open, to allow qubit info to fly in between 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{1},x_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{2},x_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

, passing through 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{0},x_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 as the avalanche occurs.
 That is, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

classical structure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (whatever that is) surrounding 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{0},x_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 is frozen into the past, but the qubit channel remains open.
 Which it has to, because of the no–cloning/no–erasure theorem: the no–cloing
 theorem is a statement that the singlet–entangled qubit channel located
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t_{0},x_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 must remain open, and cannot be frozen into the past.
 As long as qubits flow, they must be able to flow through there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So this sketch is now concrete enough that perhaps it is open to theoretical
 modeling.
 Lets see if we can make this so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Create a random network, i.e.
 a graph of vertexes and edges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Place entangled spin states at the vertexes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each edge is a spin-1/2 propagator.
 For the model, this is just the trivial propagator: we just copy, or rather,
 mark as identical the two spins at either vertex at the end of the edge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Embed the graph into Minkowski spacetime, such that all edges are time–like.
 (or maybe null?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pick a vertex that has no future edges: i.e.
 has no edge that connects to a vertex that is to it's future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At the selected vertex, twiddle aka 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the spin.
 Since this spin is entangled, this should propagate through the network,
 causing other qubits to correlate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I imagine there are dozens, if not hundreds of papers describing exactly
 this.
 This is part–and–parcel of the central core of quantum computing.
 But I don't know these papers, I have not read them.
 I do recall a key–word: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clock states
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which carry no information, as opposed to some other kind of state, that
 does.
 I need to search–engine this and read about it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, part of the exploration of the above network model is to look for
 avalanching behavior.
 The quantum computing people treat this as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and they want to get rid of it.
 I want to go in the opposite direction: to discover that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and thermalization happen automatically, as the result of avalanching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This makes it different from, say, Brownian motion.
 So in 1905, Einstein looks at Brownian motion, and obtains expressions
 for diffusion.
 His calculation is a certain kind of ensemble–average calculation.
 Here, we kind of know that ensemble–averaging 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cannot work
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because the no–cloning theorem blocks it.
 So we need a different mechanism, and that mechanism has to be avalanching
 through wave–function phases.
 Small disturbances have to be amplified into large re–arrangements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me change the topic slightly.
 So I'm reading about Brownian motion on Wikipedia, and I was staring at
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_theorem which is about graph
 Laplacians, and this pops out at me: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
...the Laplacian L can be factored into the product of the incidence matrix
 and its transpose, ...
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and two things pop into my mind: First, the smooth–space Laplacian is the
 infinite–dimensional version of this in that the (transpose of the) incidence
 matrix is the gradient, an the incidence matrix itself is the divergence,
 so div dot grad is the Laplacian.
 But I've never seen a first–principles derivation of that limit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How would that work? The graph–network connectivity of Euclidean space is
 kind–of–ish infininte–dimensional, in that the continuum is uncountable.
 The Laplacian is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

just
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the limit of the graph laplacian for an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but is also rotationally invariant, and so ...
 Ugh.
 Some mashup of Cantor sets and Grassman variables and tensor algebras.
 The analogies are all there, the groundwork is laid, the proper, formal
 treatment of the limit has not been taken.
 But also, hand in hand with this is the Dirac equation: it's also kind
 of like the

\emph on
product of the incidence matrix and its transpose
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\emph default
but going off into the Weyl spinors that can be built from the Clifford
 algebra on the tangent space.
 That is, the the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

incidence matrix
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a map between a manifold and it's tangent space, the divergence goes
 in the opposite direction (using the manifold metric for the dot product)
 and so the usual Laplacian is build from the contraction of the two, given
 a scalar.
 But one can also build Weyl spinors from the tangent bundle, and contracting
 those gives the Dirac eqn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the first step is to try to explain how an incidence matrix is just
 like a map between a manifold and it's tangent space.
 Having established that analogy, lets now construct a Clifford algebra
 from the graph edges.
 Which is fun, because we can now use the notation 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

e
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for both an edge, and a basis vector.
 Heh.
 And thence, from this Clifford algebra, we construct the graph analog of
 Weyl spinors, and then, from these, the graph analog of the Dirac equation.
 Again, I suppose someone has done this already.
 Who? Would search engines know? Would grok know?

One issue with doing and reading mathematics is that there is a combinatorial
 explosion of interconnections between concepts, most which do not matter,
 and some which do.
 Today, I thought I'd read about the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Parsi-Sourlas approach to Langevin SDEs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is fine, except that almost immediately, I hit on the Fadeev-Popov
 expression for a Jacobian determinant.
 The underlying reason for this comes from the Berezinian, or more precisely,
 the Berezin superintegral representation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int\exp\left[-\theta^{T}A\eta\right]\,d\theta\,d\eta=\det A
\]

\end_inset

which follows directly from the definition of determinants and the anti-commutin
g properties of the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

.
 Then this catches my eye:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int\exp\left[-\tfrac{1}{2}\theta^{T}M\theta\right]\,d\theta=\begin{cases}
\mathrm{Pf}\,M & n\mbox{ even}\\
0 & n\mbox{ odd}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

which gives the Pfaffian, 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mathrm{Pf}\,M)^{2}=\det M$
\end_inset

 and oh, OK, I'd forgotten about that.
 Thanks for the reminder.
 So I skim wikipedia, it reminds me that skew–symmetric matrices can be
 brought into a block-diagonal form.
 Which makes me think of the canonical symplectic form on symplectic vector
 spaces and then I spin out, trying to remember everything I know about
 Hamiltonian mechanics, but this is useless, as its boiling the ocean.

The other direction my mind spins out to is the Jacobian determinant.

separable space
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, and this sentence jumped out: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

every continuous function on a separable space whose image is a subset of
 a Hausdorff space is determined by its values on the countable dense subset.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Shit.
 I've seen this happen before, years ago, while working on the beta expansion,
 and I said to myself 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

oh that's interesting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but out of ignorance, didn't make the connection to separable space.
 And now that I have, I want to got back, and look at those old, old results,
 examine them again, but I don't remember where I wrote them down.
 That's irritating.
 And if I did go back, would that change anything? Would there have been
 just one tiny bit more of insight? Maybe, maybe not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, let me write down one tiny bit of math nonsense right now, and see if
 I can confuse myself.
 Its trivial, its basic.
 Why are trivial and basic things confusing? Lets start with the conventional
 Cantor set, modelled as an infinite binary tree.
 There are an uncountable number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

leaves
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the tree, despite two paradoxes: each branch–point can be enumerated
 (and associated with the dyadic rationals, for example), which means the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gap
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between two branches is also associated with a dyadic rational.
 However, all of the measure of the reals is associated with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

perfect sets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the leaves at the end of the binary tree.
 The rationals being a set of measure zero.
 So, separability says that continuous functions are determined by values
 on the dense subset, but the measure is determined by not that.
 Curious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I guess that what this is saying is that continuous functions are necessarily
 integrals of functions in general.
 That is, integrals of possibly discontinuous functions.
 Curious.
 Normally, continuity is defined via limits and limit points and whatnot.
 This insight suggests that continuity can also be defined by integration.
 Hmm.
 Can that work? So the Hausdorff axiom T2 does not require limits; its just
 a separation axiom.
 Integrability requires a measure, and so my nonsense seems to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

every continuous function is the integral of some measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Well, except that the measure has to satisfy certain properties, like sigma-add
itivity.
 Fuck all.
 I need to go on that bike ride.
 Skimming the rest of the WP article on Separable spaces just sends me deeper
 into the rabbit hole.
 A twisty little maze of passages, all different.

 As always, the plan is free association.

\begin_layout Standard
Prelude: my bike rides are from home, west of downtown Austin, hike & bike
 trail, to Southern Walnut Creek trail , to Daffan Road, and back.
 So about 30 miles round trip.
 Sometimes to Manor, which gets it up over 40 miles.
 Bragging to my future self.
 Medium pace, about 1/4th of it in top gear, the rest in second from top.
 Maybe 2.5 hours to Daffan and back, depending on the rest stops (I take
 2 or 3).
 Old hard–fork, hard–tail mountain bike.
 Not some fancy–ass road bike.
 I typically lose about 2.5 kg per ride, despite taking a liter of water

\begin_layout Standard
The thoughts are the usual clothes–washing machine jumble of physics/math,
 human psychology as I personally experience it, a torrid understanding
 of sociology, here and now, the nature of reality.
 I read some editorial from Carlo Rubio recently, about how physicists should
 stick to trying to improve current theories, instead of inventing all brand–new
 stuff.
 And I guess I agree, at some certain level.
 Mostly I've come to the conclusion that most of the academic community,
 in any academic field whatsoever, is pretty mediocre.
 Rubio doesn't say this, but to paraphrase, they shouldn't be playing the
 lottery, hoping to strike it rich.
 They should put in a solid days work working to improve things as they
 are.
 So yeah, lottery tickets don't pan out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Me? I'm more or less retired, free of constraints.
 I wandered aimlessly through life, so clearly, that will not change now.
 I would like to be more focused, I suppose.
 but on what? And that segues into the first topic I thought about during
 the bike ride: a mash up for free will, of feeling frustrated, motivations,
 drives.
 The entire complex of human psychological drives that makes people do what
 they do.
 There are three or four approaches to this.
 The first is to map the territory: this is what the discipline of psychology
 does.
 Including all the various aberrations.
 The second is to link these to neural structures, to synaptic biochemistry,
 re–uptake inhibitors and all that.
 Third is to look for self–organizing behavior that drives systems to critical
 points with avalanching behavior.
 An example of the third is something I read recently, a few weeks ago:
 Complex harmonics reveal low–dimensional manifolds of critical brain dynamics.
 Gustavo Deco, Yonatan Sanz Perl, and Morten L.
 Kringelbach https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.014410
 This was a decent paper.
 Focused, scientific, tools and techniques, measurements and results, but
 in some ways 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

pretty far out there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Hopf Model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and that thinking, decision–making are best understood as sequences of
 avalanches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fourth approach is to ignore Carlo Rubio, and go all mystical.
 Why do systems 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self–organize
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? This is a stupid question, because there is a simple answer: we live in
 3D space, made of atoms and chemistry, and energy flows, turbulence, yadda
 yada means that self–organizing systems near the point of criticality are
 extremely common in nature.
 That's the answer.
 Not sure why one would want to look for a mystical answer, when the obvious,
 the conventional, mainstream physics and chemistry and thermodynamics supplies
 a perfectly adequate mainstream answer.
 Shut up and calculate, Feynman might say.
 But I don't want to shut up, and calculating is hard.
 I no longer trust main–stream answers in how I should spend my time, and
 I guess no one else does, either.
 We are in an apocalyptic social upheaval because no one knows what the
 point of it is, they are driven by mammalian brains to act in some way
 or another, like wild animals running free in the noosphere.
 So this meta–meta–meta structure of the noosphere and how it couples to
 drives and motivation, reasons and behavior and action, it fairly well
 calls out for something more than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the neurons made me do it
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 But how? Can I do it without skipping key steps? Can I do it without self–indoc

 Take a shot.

\begin_layout Standard
So I think of several things while riding.
 First, I return to free will and here–and–now.
 So the model of here–and–now is that the past is frozen, the present is
 some phase transition from a fluid present to a frozen past.
 So I think about free–will and how to detach it from determinism.
 And that is when it pops into my mind: where is the future? If the present
 is here, where is the boundary to the future? Is it a hard boundary? Is
 it soft? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other things I'm thinking about at the same time is about descriptive
 set theory.
 First rung on that ladder is if course the notion of separable spaces.
 And of course, the continuum holds a special place.
 Above the continuum, we start wandering in several directions.
 First is the replacement of indicator functions by the suboject classifier.
 The Yoneda lemma, all that.
 But before gong there, the Wikipedia article on separable spaces points
 out that you can certainly have spaces with zoos of cardinals in them.
 Which then points to another apperception: that the things we say about
 cardinals are algebraic.
 So descriptive set theory – the Borel hierarchy, all that, is algebraic
 in nature.
 Collections of proofs, proofs are symbolic manipulations, which we like
 to ascribe meanings, like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inifinity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but these are vibes ..
 snowballing into platonic reality.
 Some people want to say that free will has something to do with the Axiom
 of Choice, and maybe it does and maybe it doesn't, its certainly very premature
 to go there, because it is a linguistic vibe that is suggesting some associatio
n there.
 And perhaps that linguistic vibe captures an echo of truth, and maybe it
 doesn't.
 Whatever.
 Did I shoot my wad too early? I was just getting started.

Where was I? Something something algebra.
 What is the foundation for it all? Some platonic reality, that underlies
 the physical reality? The platonic reality is soft and infirm in many ways:
 with and without AC.
 With and without CH, per Paul Cohen forcing.
 Worse: the theory of oracles in comp sci: I guess maybe one way to think
 of oracles is that they are again, algebraic in nature, much like the way
 that we use symbols for denoting cardinals, until we run out of symbols
 to write cardinals with, but there are always still more, the Large Cardinals.
 Or Axioms thereof.
 Except with oracles, we slice in a different way: we make symbological
 assertions about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what can be known
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, i.e.
 computable by a Turing machine, and then write symbols for things that
 go beyond that point, and call them oracles.
 They don't exist, the same way that infinities don't exist, but we are
 happy to do algebras of infinities, and we are happy to do algebras of
 oracles.
 We are happy for ZFC with AC and happy for it without AC.
 Huh.
 I wonder if there are like, two versions of things that pertain to oracles:
 those with and without AC? Why, I suppose there are.
 I actually wrote a paper, something about dynamical systems and Vitali
 sets, so I actually got to think about the simplest aspects of that theory
 a bit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And see, here I hit two problems: should I study these topics, or should
 I study something else? Physics, as we currently know it, is about quantum
 fields, and spacetime.
 With energy flows and photons and turbulence, so why am I looking for free
 will in the theory of oracles and descriptive set theory, when instead
 I should be looking for simplified models of U(1) electromagnetic fields
 as the foundation–stone for here–and–now? Because here–and–now really does
 take place here–and–now, in the physical world, and not in the platonic
 realm.
 Critics might say that I vastly over–extend myself in imagining a bridge
 between that platonic world, and the physical reality of here–and–now.
 Critics.
 But not Micheal Levin, with his Ingressing Minds paper.
 He's got this take that is both mystical and hard–nosed: platonic reality
 is pervasive, pervasively filigreed into the physical world, the so–called
 unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in physics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, but here's the thing: each little ingress is disconnected.
 We use one set of theories for QFT, and another set for describing turbulence,
 and these two applications have very nearly nothing in common.
 I did read some annoying article, just today, in Quanta Magazine, god I
 hate that magazine.
 Reading it makes me dumber.
 That article was about some mathematicians who solved superdiffusion using
 some new math technique that gives legs to the renormalization group.
 Something about sticking turbulence on a grid, and looking for flows or
 averages or something on that grid, an infinite number of renormalization
 group steps or something.
 Who knows.
 Quanta magazine makes me dumber.
 Maybe the have some flow on some infinite–dimensional manifold who the
 fuck knows.
 So anyway, that does provide a formal algebraic, proof–theoretic bridge
 between turbulence and viscosity, between turbulence and the Wiener process?
 And there are existing bridges wherein Wiener processes show up in quantum
 things, because Hilbert spaces, and the Cameron–Martin theorem, and see,
 we are now back to Banach Spaces, and separable spaces, and cardinals ..
 so there is a link.
 It's distant and tortured, but there's a link.
 And now I want to extend that tortured link to both human psychology and
 life as a self–organized critical process with avalanches, but I also want
 to go in a different direction, and hunt for free will.
 Its like I want to go scuba diving while at the top of Mt.
 Everest.
 Is that so unreasonable? Doesn't everybody want to go scuba diving at the

\begin_layout Standard
It is now after 1AM and I cannot sustain this in a meaningful fashion, so

 Every day is friction: what you want to do, vs what you are allows by the

Thought about filtrations of the Wiener process as I fell asleep.
 Somehow, thinking of it in this way opens new mental spaces that were somehow

 I suppose the most interesting thought worth writing down just right now

\begin_inset Formula $Z=\int\left[d\varphi\right]\exp-i\int d^{4}x\mathcal{L}\left(\varphi,\dot{\varphi}\right)$

I started thinking about separable spaces, and, just like we have algebra
 with which to talk about uncountable cardinals, and algebra to talk about

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Vitali sets are weird
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, in the sense of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

they lie outside the bounds of the intuitive

 They can still be described.

Here's another quote from that article: 
\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

a finite collection of symbols that can be arranged on a page, subject to
 a finite collection of rules that govern their rearrangement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These rules include things like axiom schemas and group presentations,
 which have regular patterns that allow them to be consistently manipulated,
 e.g.
 in second–order logic.
 So this is kind of a statement about model theory, I guess, and of course,
 model theory does not normally live in a space, and we do not normally
 give models a topology.
 But then it is possible to get into the semantics of algorithms, and talk
 about their homotopic rearrangements.
 This is an example where math gets recursive into itself.
 Yet another example, one might say.

If I take a nap, streams of unconnected thoughts pass through me head.
 Discontinuous, one might say.
 But they are all my thoughts, in my head, so there is some connection between
 them, namely, me, my experience.
 Discontinuity is for those who cannot perceive the continuity.
 The word salad generated by a mental patient (or our president) is word
 salad that is only meaningless when the listener cannot perceive the communicat
ive content within it.
 Within the head of the president, there are a bundle of connected thoughts
 involving tariffs, and those thoughts are driven by the neural processes
 in his brain.
 They are continuous, one could say.
 The communicative content is primarily emotional and psychological.
 It's clear that he is generally clueless on basic concepts, like what tariffs
 are, when economists use that word.
 So he may have been trying to communicate something, but, it comes out
 as nonsense, if you have even some basic understanding of how money and
 economies work.
 So, in that sense, the president is crazy or delusional.
 Or senile, or had some stroke when he was 20 and still hasn't fully recovered.
 Something wrong in his head.
 But he is trying to communicate that something seems unfair to him, and
 his style of communication resonates with the voters.
 So there is some sort of communicative content in there.
 I don't know how to compute, for example, the Shannon entropy of it.
 Why? Because words have meaning, and I don't know how to encode the meaning
 of words into some measure of communicative entropy.
 Second, the meaning he has assigned to words like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

tariffs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is so non–standard, so divergent from rational discourse, that it is effectivel
y poetic.
 He communicates in word salads, and the formal syntactic structure of those
 salads is barely present, and the conventional semantic content is almost
 entirely absent.
 He is shadow–boxing with meaning, and his true believers claim to see coherence

So now I am reviewing his work via duckduckgo images.
 And I am reminded that almost all visual artists seem to be hacking the
 space of fractal scaling properties.
 Almost all painting consists of whorls within whorls, distribute with just
 the right balance, just the right scale.
 Often in a uniform fashion, like some Indian filigree, paisley patterns.
 Like Takashi Murakami.
 I dunno.
 Artists have a thing.
 A style.
 A theme they try to explore.
 There's a regularity.
 That regularity is hacking something in the human visual cortex, but it
 does so that it also tickles higher layers of abstraction.
 As our eyes scan a painting, we recognize elements of the composition,
 and find surprise: oh, look, I recognize this and that, and this tickles
 abstract conceptions.
 There are any number of 16th century paintings depicting stigmata, I dunno,

And get this: of course, I hate Trump, he's destroying America, he's a criminal,
 a traitor, deserves to hang, deserves to be used as a human pinata.
 And he's no artist.
 But he has tapped into a particular vibe that resonates throughout many
 Americans.
 And so what are vibes, really? Assemblages of perceived meaning.
 The words of the Pope are structured and meaningful, and a lifetime of
 careful sculpting is required before a Pope is elected.
 But what is being sculpted? Vibes.
 Feelings.
 Emotional reverberations.
 Yes, of course, based on the vast volume of Catholic theology, Catholic
 dogma.
 There's a bazillion pages of the stuff; no cardinal has ever read any but
 a tiny fraction of it, its impossible to devote a thousand lifetimes to
 its study, expect by means of a thousand distinct humans.
 But shaped within that dogmatic text are the outlines of some higher supreme
 purpose that is supposed to mean something, with that meaning having been
 refined and revised in two thousand years.
 And that is why, perhaps, religious appeal is waning: those old shapes
 do not capture the modern zeitgeist.
 But Trump does capture it.
 A baby, a toddler, a brat.
 A conman.
 Soulless, an ugly personality, corrupt, evil, the face of evil, but this
 corruption and evil resonates with the MAGA voters.
 The collection of world–views inside the minds of the MAGA voters resonate
 with abundant evil.
 How did this come to be? How did a modern liberal capitalist society, dedicated
 to freedom of expression, foster the accumulation of evil and hatred and
 all that is bad? And I see this not just in MAGA, but also, in BlueSky,
 with all the Marxists that Will Stancil attracts like a moth to flames.
 The Marxists are equally ugly, intolerant, nasty brutes, filled with both
 hatred, and bereft of understanding.
 Yet, as adult human beings they can function within society, not just feed
 themselves, pay the rent on time, but hold down jobs and maintain friendships.
 So, the brain functions and adapts to its surroundings.
 The issue is that the surroundings enable the construction of Towers of
 Babel of incoherent thoughts.
 At some deep, base vibe layer, there is some sense, some sensation of how

 During zooms of the Mandelbrot set, one is at first awed by the seemingly
 vast variety of different shapes within it.
 But then, after a while, it calms down: you start to see the same patterns,
 over and over.
 Repeated.
 Mutated into different shapes, pleasing to the eye.
 But finite, in a certain sense, in the variety that they offer.
 No two swirls are alike, and yet the archetypes are quite limited in number.
 So there is uniformity in that variety.
 How do we express this uniformity of variety? Well, there are ideas of
 self–similarity.
 For every bit–string, we can insert from a dictionary of substrings: dictionary

 The mapping is difficult: closed–form expressions and mathematical theorems
 for the Mandelbrot set are hard to come by.

 In the sciences, it's to take a certain line of research, and push, push

 But then, what is history? It too seems to be malleable: an accretion of

 Thermalization.
 The eddies within eddies of turbulence were once there, in the past.
 But they were not recorded, and what we have now is the thermalized leftovers.
 From velocity to viscosity.
 The thermalization of turbulence happens not just to literal turbulence,

 That is, not only can we not modify the past, we also can't go back there

 that branch–points are a set of measure zero that is dense in the deterministic

 And, as per Weierstrass type ideas, the fate of the universe is determined
 by the decisions made on this dense subset of branch–points.
 That is, the Hugh Everett thing was claiming that these branch points lead
 to many worlds, and i'm trying to collapse those back down to just one.

\end_inset

radio receiver
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the distance between them is exactly zero.
 Ergo, they are the same point.
 Right? Well, obviously not: one is on the Moon (or on Mars) and the other
 is on Earth.
 In the lab frame, space is locally 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and has the conventional Hausdorff topology induced by the Cartesian metric
 in 3-space.
 However, I do not understand the topology induced by the Minkowski metric.
 I have never–ever seen a text that describes this topology.
 What do the search engines say? Lets find out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But first, to document the rest of the thoughts: my earlier blather about
 backwards–time propagating wave functions used to resolve inconsistencies
 to obtain some transactional interpretation of quantum collapse: this is
 wrong, or mostly wrong, or grossly misleading.
 The point of entanglement is that collapse happens 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

everywhere at once
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So consider the measurement of a pair of spin-1/2 particles combined into
 a spin singlet.
 The measurement is non–local, so that the wave function of both particles,
 A and B, collapse at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

same time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Or rather, they collapse at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

same here–and–now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is again counter–intuitive: we imagine a Stern–Gerlach setup.
 The non–uniform magnetic field causes the spin–up and spin–down components
 of the wave function to spatially separate.
 They are, however, still in superposition; no collapse has occurred yet.
 The collapse does occur when the wave–function interacts with the particle
 detector, and this interaction is necessarily a many–body interaction,
 a thermalization.
 And this interaction occurs at the same here–and–now for both A and B.
 Not the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

same time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because A and B might be space–like separated by the time the measurements
 are performed, and there is no preferred space–like surface with which
 we can say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

same time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So collapse need not, does not happen 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

at the same time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but it does happen at the same here–and–now.
 Even more strongly: here–and–now is one point, the same point.
 Both entangled spinors are located at the same here–and–now point.
 So, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

of course
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, any interaction that one undergoes is matched by interactions the other
 undergoes.
 Again, the is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trivial
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and conventionally expressed in bra–ket notation: we write 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 when we talk about a wave function, and it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

everywhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all at once
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

at the same time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and if it need to be localized, then the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle x\right.\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle x,t\right.\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is used.
 So the standard QM notation already acknowledges, implicitly, that the
 wave function is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

everywhere all at once
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I'm not introducing anything new here.
 I am only re–arranging emphasis on the topology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, back to the Hausdorff topology, or lack of it, or whatever, for Minkowski
 space.
 Oh wait.
 The other thing is that the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 represents a pure state in Hilbert space: it is a single point.
 So the collapse is taking place at a single point, and that point is located
 at here–and–now.
 This is the case for when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 represents a massive particle, and not just a photon.
 That is to say, here–and–now–ness is not just a quotient topology induces
 by the Minkowski metric; rather, its a topology induced on the mapping
 from spacetime to Hilbert space.
 That is, we get the quotient topology for Minkowski space because the metric
 is induced by the wave equation for U(1) on–shell photons.
 Oh! Now I am making progress! So, the Minkowski metric is NOT some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

natural structure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of space–time.
 Instead, the Minkowski metric is an artifact induced by the physical process
 of photon wave–functions collapsing! It is the collapse of the wave–function
 that happens at one point, at here–and–now, and when the wave–function
 is described by the massless wave equation, only then does Minkowski space
 get induced as a quotient of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{4}$
\end_inset

 modulo a null geodesic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This does feel a bit circular, and I should address that.
 Two write down the wave equation, I have to write the D'Alambertian 
\begin_inset Formula $\square$
\end_inset

 and to write that, I have to use the Minkowski metric.
 And yet, I wanted to derive the Minkowski metric, not assume it.
 I think this is OK, because I think I can use conventional concepts of
 atlases of maps to define the diff geom needed to write down 
\begin_inset Formula $\square$
\end_inset

 and that this can be done without breathing a sigh of Hausdorff topology
 (or Lindelöf space, or whatever.) Yes, under the surface, the use of the
 word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

continuous
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

differentiable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 implicitly require the assumption of normal spaces or Polish spaces or
 Hausdorff spaces, so those topics are there, under the covers.
 But we don't have any paradoxes that float to the surface.
 Everything goes through, without contradictions.
 The paradoxes arise entirely from wave–function collapse, which is a topic
 entirely orthogonal to the diff geom os pseudo–Riemannian spaces.
 So I think that is how the seemingly circular logic is broken.
 That is, there are
\emph on
 two 
\emph default
spaces: the Minkowski space on which 
\begin_inset Formula $\square$
\end_inset

 is defined, and the space of functions from Minkowski space to Hilbert
 space, which is where here–and–now is defined.
 And that photon interactions induce a Minkowski metric onto this Hilbert
 space.
 And that wave–function collapse for massive particles induces ...
 I dunno, something something on this space.
 And the space that we perceive, as living things, is NOT Minkwoski space,
 but instead the space of functions from Minkowski space to Hilbert space.
 I mean, yeah, duh, this is kind of the whole point, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obvious thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that QM is saying.
 That yeah, duh, reality is defined by QM.
 But somehow, at least for me, it never sunk in, it never hit, the way it's
 hitting now.
 I am, I think we all are so used to Cartesian, Newtonian reality that we
 can comprehend QM just fine as undergrads, without ever once fully taking
 to heart the nature of the actual space in which the actual wave functions
 live.
 Which is what I've done.
 So I am now undergoing a yeah–duhh moment, almost fifty years after I learned
 QM.
 (I learned it my junior year in College, and even better my senior year.
 That was 1979 and 1980 and I would have been 19 and 20 years old, so about
 45 years ago.) So for forty–five years, I failed to, uhh, grasp something,
 uhh, basic.
 Simple and basic.
 How embarrassing.
 Fuck me.
 Lets make up for lost time, shall we?

But i have to take a break, because I've got other things I have to get
 done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hang on, just a few more minutes.
 I am confused by two things.
 First, what is the open cover, the metric topology induced by the Minowski
 metric? It sure doesn't feel Hausdorff to me, but maybe I'm crazy.
 That's the first topic that needs clarification.
 The second topic is about the sigma algebra on the space of functions from
 Minkowski space to Hilbert space.
 So, write 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 for Minkowski space, write 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 for Hilbert space.
 I'm concerned about the sigma algebra on the space of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi:M\to\Psi$
\end_inset

.
 What is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

? So here is the sleight–of–hand.
 For a scalar particle, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 is one–dimensional! Consider textbook harmonic oscillator (in one dimension).
 The structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 is so trivial, it is almost not mentioned.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi=\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 and there's kind of not a whole lot else that can be said here and its
 obvious and textbooks promptly move on and define a Hilbert space of 
\begin_inset Formula $H=\left\{ \psi:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and show how this space is spanned by the Hermite polynomials.
 So the sleight–of–hand is to immediately jump from 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 without remarking very much on this jump.
 Its too trivial.
 All of the interesting things to be said are the things to say about 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 and how its square integrable, and about weak convergence on the weak topology
 in the infinite–dimensional product space 
\begin_inset Formula $H=\left\{ e_{n}:n\in\mathbb{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 because this is where all the conventional interesting things can be said.
 And this is hammered on in such a way that mediocre students, and even
 smart students, somehow fail to notice that we are not talking about Euclidean
 space, but about something completely different, and then we students try
 to map Euclidean notions from common–sense child–hood experience of space
 onto this infinite–dimensional Hilbert space, and end up confused by questions
 like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how can it be a particle and a wave at the same time?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 And the dis–service of the textbook, and the lecturer is to somehow not
 hammer on the point 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

its not Euclidean space, dear students, it's infinite dimensional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it is a fundamental error to think about 3D space when you should be thinking
 of infinite–dimensional space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The point here is that at the same time, there are business–school students
 down the hall, studying stochastic processes and Itô calculus and Wiener
 space, and those students are NOT asking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how can it be a single stock price and a random process at the same time?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because they already know stock prices are not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

particles
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 localized in 3D space.
 it would be dumb to ask 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

where is the stock price right now, in 3D space?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because the answer is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nowhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or it is perhaps 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or perhaps 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

on the settlement computer in the back room.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 But for quantum, everyone asks 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

where is the particle right now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as if that is a meaningful question (it's not), and they talk about particle–wa
ve duality like it's a thing, when the obviously analogous situation, of
 stock–price vs.
 stochastic–process duality is not a thing anyone ever talks about.
 Sheesh.
 I'm wasting a lot of words and time to write this, but feel compelled to,
 because there must be a thousand youtube videos on particle–wave duality
 is if it were a thing, when in fact it's kind of the wrong question and
 the wrong framework predicated on a confusion between 3D Euclidean space
 and the infinite–dimensional Hilbert space.
 Fuck me.
 I am wasting my time even writing this, but whatever.
 Lets get back on track.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now have two or three tasks in front of us.
 First, explain the topology of 
\begin_inset Formula $H=\left\{ \mathbb{R}^{3}\to\mathbb{C}\right\} $
\end_inset

 but this is easy because this is conventional Hilbert space.
 Next, and I am afraid of giving notation to this, is to add time, and describe
 wave–function collapse.
 I think this requires using a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and describing
 dynamics in that space.
 I will have to ponder this some more, later on.
 Not now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next on the list is entanglement.
 Here, it is a single spinor, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 is two–dimensional: its the vector space having the basis spin–up and spin–down.
 And since the topic is entanglement, we really have 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi=\mathbf{C}\otimes\mathbf{C}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{C}$
\end_inset

 is the Riemann sphere (complex–projective one–space) which is the Hilbert
 space inhabited by spin–one–half spinors.
 This space has to local (tangent space) decomposition 
\begin_inset Formula $su_{2}\otimes su_{2}=so_{3}\oplus u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and this is all trivial textbook stuff, but I repeat it to kind of emphasize
 that these are all different, distinct spaces, each having their own geometry
 and topology, and that we (meaning I) make grave errors when conflating
 these distinct objects.
 So don't conflate them! Well, except I already made a grave error: I'm
 talking about spinors loosely, when I should distinguish Weyl spinors,
 Dirac spinors and the much simpler idea of the Riemann sphere.
 These all inter–relate, of course, but premature abuse of the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spinor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 gets us into trouble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, lets see ..
 where were we? I wish to examine the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $H=\left\{ \mathbb{R}^{3}\to\mathbf{C}\otimes\mathbf{C}\right\} $
\end_inset

 except that this is not enough: I want to examine 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{t}=\left\{ \mathbb{R}^{3}\to\mathbf{C}\otimes\mathbf{C}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 So really I want to look at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}=\bigotimes_{t\in\mathbb{R}^{+}}H_{t}\simeq\left\{ \mathbb{R}^{+}\times\mathbb{R}^{3}\to\mathbf{C}\otimes\mathbf{C}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and I think that is the correct notation but I have to be careful, because
 there's a sigma algebra that has to manifest here, and I'm not sure I wrote
 that appropriately.
 Whatever.
 Onwards through the fog, Oat Willie! Next, during the analysis of wave
 function collapse in this space, I want to show that this induces a metric,
 crudely resembling the Minkowski metric, but instead of it being the speed
 of light, it has to be at the group velocity of the wave–packets of the
 two entangled spinors propagating in opposite directions.
 And calling it an induced metric is kind–of–ish wrong, because the induction
 only happens at the here–and–now of the collapse, which is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

everywhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but more specifically, where the wave packets are localized when they
 hit the detector.
 There are two implications here: all points in a single detector are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

at the same place, right now, here–and–now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, AND ALSO, the points in detector A are at the same here–and–now location
 as the points in detector B.
 That is, both detectors are entangled.
 That is, I am looking for a modulo relationship, the here–and–now relationship,
 write it as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 so that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

actual space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the quotient space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}/\sim$
\end_inset

.
 That is, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

physical reality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that we live in is not 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 and its not 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 but it is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}/\sim$
\end_inset

 and the equivalence relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 induces a Minkowski–like metric–like structure on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}/\sim$
\end_inset

 .
 Its all happening everywhere, all at once! Auumm! We are one with the universe!
 BTW the movie 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Everything Everywhere All At Once
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a great movie! And I'm not trying to do pop–culture here, but the appercepti
on that wave–function collapse happens everywhere all at once is already
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

well known
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to everyone, and yet it remains befuddling to actual physicists who have
 to actually work with this stuff.
 And it is certainly befuddling to me.
 And so my goal here is to try to remedy that.
 Fuck me.
 Nothing like explaining the obvious.
 Like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shit falls down, Newton, yeah, duh
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 except I'm not Newton.
 Fuck me.
 What am I doing?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, the goal of writing it as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}=\bigotimes_{t\in\mathbb{R}^{+}}H_{t}$
\end_inset

 is to be suggestive, to give the flavor or suggestion of stochastic processes,
 expect it's for probability amplitudes not probabilities.
 And also that, in analogy to the natural filtration for the Wiener process,
 there is a natural filtration here, as well.
 But it has to be written down and articulated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK.
 Now I really do have to take a break and do something else.
 But I feel like I have made actual forward progress to pin down the issue,
 We shall see...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
20 May 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please note: For the topics above, I do all my thinking while falling asleep.
 During the daytime hours, I do something else.
 So progress can be slow or absent, depending.
 I'm back down to slow progress, but thought I should write up something
 obvious, again.
 So we have a pure state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and it has no physical location.
 To use bad language, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it's a particle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but it has no location in 3D space.
 The formalities of QM allow an expression to be obtained, written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\left\langle x,t\right.\left|\psi\right\rangle \right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 which is interpreted as the probability of detecting a particle at location
 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,t)$
\end_inset

 were there a particle detector placed at that location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship to choice is this.
 Consider, to keep things easy, a two–slit setup, with interference fringes,
 and photographic film as detector.
 The nature of the interaction with the film is such that the single–photon
 state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, which had no 3D location (let's make it 1D, since this is diffraction)
 is now forced to choose a location 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 such that, upon wave function collapse, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\left\langle x\right.\left|\psi\right\rangle \right|^{2}\approx\delta\left(x-x_{c}\right)$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the photon collided with the silver halide grain located at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This game seems to have the following rules: (1) the particle is given a
 choice: the wave function can collapse anywhere at all, but when it does
 collapse, it must collapse to a single point.
 (2) Upon many repetitions with the same prepared state, the expectation
 value of collapse locations will conform to classical diffraction.
 (3) A micro–theory of photon interaction with silver halide grains needs
 to be developed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, of course, part (3) is hard, and it is tempting to skip it, and I probably
 will, eventually.
 However, it's also the interesting part.
 As the wave function is collapsing, it is interacting with **all** of the
 silver–halide grains 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

at the same time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in the here–and–now.
 That is, all of them are entangled during the collapse process.
 Huh.
 I wonder if I can write an expression for this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But first: Note this entanglement is time–less.
 That is, imagine that the film is cut, so that the portion of the film
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x<0$
\end_inset

 is much much closer to the slits than the portion 
\begin_inset Formula $x>0$
\end_inset

.
 This combines the Renninger negative–measurement experiment with the two–slit
 experiment.
 The distances are such that the time–of–flight is much larger than the
 wavepacket size, so that if the wavepacket collapses to a location 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}<0$
\end_inset

 it does so chronologically much earlier than if it collapsed to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}>0$
\end_inset

.
 What the Renninger negative–measurement experiment tells us is that not
 only does 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 not have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

location in space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but it also does not have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

location in time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And I think this observation is exactly what I need to resolve the confusion
 about why here–and–now is insensitive to Lorentz covariance.
 That is, here–and–now is happening not only everywhere, but it is also
 happening at all times.
 The wording of this last sentence is awkward.
 Perhaps it is this: here–and–now ties together collections of points in
 spacetime.
 Not just points in space, but in spacetime.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this specific example, it ties together those spacetime points located
 at the intersection of photo–film location and wave–packet flight–time.
 Note that some of these points are space–like separated, and some are time–like
 separated.
 So, for example, two points 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}<0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}<0$
\end_inset

 might be space–like separated, if the distance between them is much larger
 than the wave–packet size 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

.
 That is, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|x_{1}-x_{2}\right|>c\Delta t$
\end_inset

.
 However, imagine doing the experiment with, say, electrons, not photons,
 so that the wavepacket group velocity is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 Then a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{3}>0$
\end_inset

 could be in the causal future of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}<0$
\end_inset

.
 Which is the point of the Renninger arrangement: to place the film such
 that a portion of it is very distinctly in the causal future of the other
 part, and so far in the future, that it is much larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, let us now attempt to write down an expression for the entanglement
 of silver–halide grains in the here–and–now.
 I will write three or four paragraphs of quotidian mathematical details
 below.
 These will be boring and almost entirely irrelevant to the core idea.
 They serve only to provide a concrete, specific example, so that you, dear
 reader, and perhaps I myself, don't remain in the ozone of abstraction,
 forever.
 The below will describe the Renninger two–slit setup, but it really could
 be any detector geometry whatsoever, for detecting any kinds of particles
 from any kinds of sources.
 I'm selecting the Renninger two–slit setup because its very specific and
 concrete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So first, pixelate.
 We give each grain the size of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-N}$
\end_inset

 for some finite integer 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 We do this by taking the continuous space 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 and removing the dyadic rationals 
\begin_inset Formula $p/2^{N}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset

 and fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 We've removed a set of measure zero of points, in such a way that each
 individual silver–halide gran can interact 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

within itself
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but cannot interact with its nearest neighbors.
 That is, the individual grains are thermodynamically isolated, so that
 whatever energy is deposited into one does not, cannot leak into neighboring
 grains.
 Think CCD camera, if that makes you happier.
 A finite and uniform pixel size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematically, this is interesting, as it allows the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

 to be taken.
 The pixels then become isomorphic to the Cantor set.
 They hold all of the measure, the are infinitely tiny, they are thermodynamical
ly disconnected from their neighbors, so that thermodynamic isolation is
 equivalent to giving them a discrete topology, when using concepts from
 general topology.

Next, place the double–slit at location 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset

 and so the film plate is at 
\begin_inset Formula $y=D_{near}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $x<0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y=D_{far}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x>0$
\end_inset

.
 That is, the pixel 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is located at 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(x,y\right)=\begin{cases}
\left(p/2^{N},D_{far}\right) & \mbox{for }p\ge0\\
\left(p/2^{N},D_{near}\right) & \mbox{for }p<0
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

This can be arranged so that 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{near}=D_{far}$
\end_inset

 for the classical two–slit experiment, and, for the Renninger configuration,
 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{far}-D_{near}\gg c\Delta t$
\end_inset

 for wave–packet size 
\begin_inset Formula $c\Delta t$
\end_inset

.
 The wave packet then has the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\psi\left(x,y,t\right)\right|^{2}\sim f\left(x,y\right)b\left(-\frac{\left(\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}-vt\right)^{2}}{2a}\right)
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 the diffraction pattern, and 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 being some bump function: 
\begin_inset Formula $b:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}$
\end_inset

.
 In physics, we usually have 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 being exp, so above becomes the Gaussian; however, for the below it will
 be easier if 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 has compact support.
 So, in all respects, this is meant to be an industry–standard, textbook
 wavepacket, just one with compact support.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest is as usual: 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 the group velocity of the wave–packet, with of course, 
\begin_inset Formula $v<c$
\end_inset

 for massive particles, and 
\begin_inset Formula $v=c$
\end_inset

 for photons, and 
\begin_inset Formula $a=v\Delta t$
\end_inset

 being the wavepacket size.
 The interesting geometry is with 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{near}\gg1$
\end_inset

 so that we can approximate 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x,y\right)\approx f\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 the far–field diffraction pattern, i.e.
 we ignore all near–field effects.
 I wrote the expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 because I don't want to deal with factors of 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-i\omega t}$
\end_inset

 because they do not seem to be relevant at this time.
 I'm also ignoring any dispersion in velocity: the particles are taken to
 be monochromatic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I suppose it's worth pausing a moment to contemplate this.
 QM superposition fundamentally requires complex numbers, and the different
 world–lines in the partition function sum with a phase given by the action.
 For the current thought–experiment, none of this seems to matter, at least,
 not so far, so I will ignore these details (i.e.
 the phases) until such time that they become important.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now write down an explicit expression for the location of here–and–now.
 I'll use the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 for here–and–now, with P meaning 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

present
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Informally, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 consists of all space–time points where the wave–packet is non–zero at
 the location of the film plate.
 That is, the film–plate follows one set of world–lines, stationary in the
 lab frame, and the particles are moving, so they intersect.
 I took the effort to give the wave–packet compact support in the time direction.
 The far–field diffraction pattern is not compactly supported.
 The film–plate is of finite size, and so some of the diffraction pattern
 will miss the film–plate entirely.
 Ideally, we want to make this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

negligibly small
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and I think this is entirely reasonable.
 The common–sense physics should not depend on out–of–bounds conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So there we have it: the region 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 of space–time is where here–and–now is, at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

moment of wave function collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Except there's no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

moment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because the wave–packet size 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 is finite, and because the Renninger setup has that some points in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 are in the distant future light–cone of others, while other points of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 are space–like separated.
 That is, here–and–now is all over the place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets write a formula for this.
 Again, this is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obvious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 formula.
 Writing it down enables this text to vibe like it was written by a shape–rotato
r instead of a wordcel.
 Vibes are important.
 Even engineering texts are 100% vibes, no matter how anhedonic the engineers
 imagine themselves to be.
 Where was I? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 denote the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

'th detector pixel; it is an extended object occupying the space–time points
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}\left(x,y,t\right)$
\end_inset

 given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{i}\left(x,y,t\right)=\Theta\left(2^{N}x-i\right)\delta\left(y-D_{i}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{i}=\begin{cases}
D_{near} & \mbox{for }i<0\\
D_{far} & \mbox{for }i\ge0
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 the Dirac delta (or a suitably widened version thereof.) The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Theta\left(w\right)=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{for }-\frac{1}{2}<w<\frac{1}{2}\\
0 & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

The pixel plane 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 consists of all space–time locations 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(x,y,t\right)=\sum_{i\in\mathbb{Z}}p_{i}\left(x,y,t\right)
\]

\end_inset

or perhaps an alternate notation is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=\left\{ \left(x,y,t\right)\in M:P\left(x,y,t\right)\ne0\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 being Minkowski space–time, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $P\subset M$
\end_inset

 is a manifold.
 And it really is a manifold, it's smooth, it has coordinate charts, etc.
 It does have some points missing at some of the dyadic rationals; the pixels
 are isolated and disjoint.
 Its not compact in either the space or the time directions, but it could
 be made compact by making the detector finite–sized, and removing it at
 some point in the future.
 This would give it compact support on the light–cone as well (i.e.
 for the null directions.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The set of points 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}\subset M$
\end_inset

 are then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathscr{P}=\left\{ \left(x,y,t\right)\in M:P\left(x,y,t\right)\left|\psi\left(x,y,t\right)\right|^{2}\ne0\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

This is again a smooth submanifold that can be given coordinate charts.
 Its compact in the time direction, because 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 was defined to be compact.
 Since the pixels are disjoint, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 also consists of a set of disjoint manifolds, corresponding to each pixel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wave function collapse requires describing how the ket 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 evolves from the distant past, into the distant future, such that it deposits
 all of it's energy into a single pixel.
 Again, I emphasize that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 has no location in space–time; it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

everywhere, all at once
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Despite this, we can localize where the collapse happens: it necessarily
 takes place in the here–and–now, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary claim of this text is that the ket 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 necessarily entangles all points in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

.
 This is where things get difficult, again.
 Let's try to wordcel our way into what the difficulty is.
 What do we have? The following points:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All pixels are QM–entangled in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each pixel should be describable in some unitary QM fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each pixel also has a thermodynamic description: the natural vocabulary
 is that of measure–preserving dynamical systems.
 The insides of the pixels are ergodic; perhaps some subset of each pixel
 includes wandering sets, so that sub–portions of the pixels are dissipative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All of the particle energy has been deposited into only one pixel in the
 future light–cone of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

.
 This states that the all–pixel unitary entanglement becomes a single–pixel
 thermodynamic entanglement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, again, I have to break, and go do other things now.
 But still, it feels like I made some minor forward progress.
 I now have an explicit formal example of here–and–now as a collection of
 points in classical space–time.
 I've formalized the claim that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 necessarily entangles 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 points in the here–and–now.
 I've isolated the microscopic model so that it requires both a unitary
 description, and simultaneously an ergodic, dissipative description.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This description of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 allows it to be given a sigma algebra, but this is trivial: it is a subalgebra
 of the sigma algebra on Minkowski space.
 Which now clarifies what I did wrong above: here–and–now is NOT 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 but instead it is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is the dual space of all continuous functions from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{+}$
\end_inset

.
 I want to endow 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 with some sigma algebra.
 It is then presumably some kind of Cameron–Martin space, some reproducing
 kernel Hilbert space, something analogous to how abstract Wiener space
 is constructed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, for Wiener space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\Omega$
\end_inset

 correspond to single, specific Brownian motion paths, and by taking the
 Cartesian product 
\begin_inset Formula $I\times\Omega$
\end_inset

 one can define the Wiener process 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $X:I\times\Omega\to\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}\equiv X\left(t,\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 is called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stochastic process
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and selecting a specific point 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\Omega$
\end_inset

 identifies a specific Brownian–motion path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intended analogy here is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is kind–of–like 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, and that a specific point 
\begin_inset Formula $q\in\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a specific wave–function collapse onto a single pixel.
 The Many–Worlds Hypothesis is then the statement that each distinct 
\begin_inset Formula $q\in\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is a distinct 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

world
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and that all of these worlds 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coexist
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And, in that sense, clearly they do: I have written down an explicit and
 precise expression for the multiverse: it is exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 and nothing more and nothing less.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, since I am wordceling along, here, it is possible that I screwed something
 up, but for now, it really does seem like 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is a formal expression for the multiverse.
 Also, this is so basic, that I assume that I am rediscovering something
 that others have already published about.
 Since I have not read sufficiently in those directions, I don't know.
 And my vocabulary and terminology is sufficiently obtuse that I doubt that
 I can ask Claude or Grok or Gemini if someone else has already discovered
 all this.
 Those systems are not yet capable of answering this kind of a question.
 So, I must continue, the olde–fashioned way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing...
 the sticky part here is that Wiener space has an obvious 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 coordinate: it was build so as to be indexable.
 The points 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\Omega$
\end_inset

 have an explicit interpretation as paths.
 The sigma algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 has an explicit natural filtration 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And now here is where it gets fun.
 If we start at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

, all Brownian motion paths are possible.
 As the time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 advances, the path 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

collapses
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, so that there is a cylinder set 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C\left(t,\omega\right)=\left\{ \alpha\in\Omega:X\left(s,\alpha\right)=X\left(s,\omega\right)\mbox{ for }s<t\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

This cylinder set contains all paths that are exactly equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{s}\left(\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $s<t$
\end_inset

 and are otherwise unspecified for future times that occur after 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 – i.e.
 all possibilities are allowed, all futures are still open, subject to the
 constraint that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{s}\left(\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $s<t$
\end_inset

 has already happened, is in the past, and is immutable.
 That is, for the Wiener process, here–and–now is cleanly parameterized
 by a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 which has a clean and clear interpretation as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 What's more the filtration 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{t}$
\end_inset

 provides a clear model for past, present and future, where the pas is fixed,
 the present is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the future is undetermined, because the sigma algebra is too course.
 That is, the sigma algebras form a filtration 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{t}\subset\mathcal{F}_{u}$
\end_inset

 for future times 
\begin_inset Formula $u>t$
\end_inset

.
 They get finer, as time progresses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the sticky part is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 was constructed in such a way that, if it has a natural filtration, it
 is not clear what it is.
 If it did have a natural filtration, then that filtration could be explicitly
 identified with the process of wave–function collapse.
 That is, not only would a single point 
\begin_inset Formula $q\in\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 correspond to a specific path of collapse, but there would be some parameter
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi\left(\tau,q\right)$
\end_inset

 indicated the entanglement state of all of the pixels with the ket 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 at that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

instant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 So, first of all, I don't yet know how to explicitly write down what this
 parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is, but the insight is that perhaps wave–function collapse is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unitary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 This parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is explicitly not time; it cannot be, because the Renninger setup clearly
 demonstrates that it could never be, because the Renninger setup explicitly
 entangles future times with past times (within the same light–cone.) But
 *if* we had or could find or could impose this structural parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, then the process 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi:I\times\mathcal{P}^{\prime}\to\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 could maybe plausibly describe collapse, and also be interpreted as a kind–of
 unitary evolution, unitary not in time, but in the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I dunno.
 This does skirt dangerously close to the Bohm hidden–variable description,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 being the hidden variable.
 And I want to explicitly reject hidden variables, because we already know
 that those don't work.
 Perhaps the saving grace is that each 
\begin_inset Formula $q\in\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is meant to be interpreted as a different world in the multiverse.
 I dunno.
 So this is one of the risky points that would need to be double–checked.
 Must not accidentally reinvent hidden variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever.
 I really have to go.
 Where are we at?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I might have screwed up with the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 or it's interpretation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I don't yet know how to find this parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 or how to prove that such a parameter even exists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I don't have a microscopic model of the pixels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, this feels like forward progress, again.
 Later, dude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I guess I can put a sigma algebra and measure on either 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 and in either case it would correspond to a traditional particle cross–section.
 In this case, the film plate should also have some finite thickness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After some thought:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 as the region of spacetime where collapse takes place is correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is wrong, the desired interpretation remains desirable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One problem with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is that if the particle is a photon, its gone, by the end, but if its an
 electron, its still there.
 The other problem is that the internal state of the detectors needs to
 b a part of it.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{p}$
\end_inset

 denote the set of all possible pixel states over the entire world–line
 of pixel 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 so that a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{p}\in\Omega_{p}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the entire time evolution of the pixel from beginning of
 time to end of time, from 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p,\mbox{initial}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p,\omega,\mbox{final}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p,\mbox{initial}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 does NOT depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{p}$
\end_inset

: no matter what path the pixel takes in the future, it starts in a fixed
 state.
 Note that the final state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p,\omega_{p},\mbox{final}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 does depend on the path 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{p}$
\end_inset

 even if the pixel does NOT capture the photon: the entanglement during
 w.f.
 collapse might have changed the phase in the pixel.
 This raises the interesting possibility that there might be some effect
 similar to Aharonov–Bohm, in that phases change even though there was no
 direct detection in that pixel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Likewise, write 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 for the space of all possible continuous evolution paths for the particle,
 from the distant past to the distant future, so that the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\in\Psi$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the time evolution from 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi,\mbox{initial}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi,\mbox{final}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 With this notation, the total state space is then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E=\Psi\times\prod_{p}\Omega_{p}
\]

\end_inset

so that a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta\in E$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the evolution of the system from 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\eta,\mbox{initial}\right\rangle =\left|\psi,\left\{ p\right\} ,\mbox{initial}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\eta,\mbox{final}\right\rangle =\left|\psi,\left\{ p,\omega\right\} ,\mbox{final}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notation is meant to enable the use of S–matrix ideas, so that we can
 write 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\eta,\mbox{final}\right\rangle =S\left|\eta,\mbox{initial}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 The notation is also meant to allow the explicit analogy to Wiener space,
 so that points 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta\in E$
\end_inset

 correspond to continuous paths in the evolution of the system.
 The intended path parameter is meant to be here–and–now.
 This parameter is both a point; I guess we can treat it as a point on the
 unit real interval 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

, and it is also a region of spacetime, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 denotes the location of here–and–now where the wave–function collapse occurs.
 From the point of view of the S–matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 is just the interaction region.
 The point of the Renninger setup is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 is not star–shaped or convex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this formulation, here–and—now is both 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

instantaneous
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld

spread out
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

instantaneous
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spread out
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 That is, in the parameter space, taken to be the unit interval of the reals
 
\begin_inset Formula $I=\left\{ \rho\in\mathbb{R}:0\le\rho\le1\right\} $
\end_inset

 there are a bunch of points 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 that are before the collapse, and a bunch of points after the collapse,
 but there is just one point 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 that corresponds to the region 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

.
 For the sake of convenience, let's parameterize this so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=1/2$
\end_inset

 when the collapse happens.
 The parameter interval 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\rho<1/2$
\end_inset

 can be taken to be isomorphic to the passage of Newtonian time, or proper
 time in the lab frame, up until just before the particle wave packet begins
 to overlap the detectors.
 For this region, the Schrodinger equation (or the wave equation, as appropriate
) fully and completely describes the time evolution of the particle.
 The pixels likewise 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

do their thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in this region.
 Then, at precisely 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=1/2$
\end_inset

 we suspend all of this, and move the discussion of the S–matrix interaction
 region 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

.
 The collapse happens 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 After that, normal evolution resumes, so that the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2<\rho\le1$
\end_inset

 is again isomorphic to lab–frame proper time, and pixel evolution continues
 normally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that there is a large discontinuity: we run the lab–frame clock until
 right before the interaction starts: this time is 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\mbox{before}}$
\end_inset

 and corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\to1/2$
\end_inset

 from below.
 The time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\mbox{after}}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the lab time after which all possible interactions are over,
 it corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\to1/2$
\end_inset

 from above.
 However, in the lab, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t_{\mbox{after}}=t_{\mbox{before}}+\Delta t+\frac{D_{far}-D_{near}}{v}
\]

\end_inset

with, as before, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 being the wavepacket width, 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 the group velocity of the wavepacket, and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{near}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{far}$
\end_inset

 the detector locations.
 A different way to say this is that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\mbox{before}}$
\end_inset

 is the infimum of the proper time in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\mbox{after}}$
\end_inset

 is the supremum: the lower and upper bounds.
 Algebraically, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t_{\mbox{before}}=\inf\left\{ t:\left(x,y,t\right)\in\mathscr{P}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t_{\mbox{after}}=\sup\left\{ t:\left(x,y,t\right)\in\mathscr{P}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

That is, the wave–function collapse occurs over this extended region of
 lab–frame time.
 The wave–function collapse is instant, in parameter time.
 Then, a single point 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta\in E$
\end_inset

 is an interpolation of the system from 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\mbox{before}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\mbox{after}}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Well, So lets vastly simplify the above setup.
 Suppose there is a single photon: a plane wave.
 Suppose there are two simple harmonic oscillators: these are the detectors.
 The energy of the photon is sufficient to kick one of the oscillators into
 an excited state, but not both.
 After photon absorption, this places the system into a superposition: either
 one or the other oscillator is excited; we don't know which, both possibilities
 are in superposition.
 No 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has occurred; we've simply used the photon to prepare a superposition.
 Instead of using harmonic oscillators, one can imagine there being two
 hydrogen atoms, with the photon being sufficient to excite one of them.
 This detail doesn't matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we want to work with decoherence.
 So really, the two receiving SHO's should be weakly coupled to some network
 of other oscillators, so that their energy can bleed out to those, thus
 resulting in decoherence.
 Some interesting questions arise: would a linear chain of weakly oscillators
 be enough to decohere and thermalize? Does it have to be 2D? Some random
 network? Does it have to be up in the mean–field connectivity range? Lets
 ignore these questions for now.
 Interesting, but some other day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So how does decoherence work? (I still haven't read the Wikipedia article
 on it ...) Each SHO state is then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|n\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and since we have two of them, the combined state is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|n_{1}\right\rangle \times\left|n_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 with the Cartesian product denoting that they are NOT coherent with respect
 to one–another; they are (initially) decoupled.
 The whole point of absorbing a single photon is that it couples the two
 oscillators together, forming a single pure entangled state out of them.
 Lets try to write this down:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma\times\left|n_{1}\right\rangle \times\left|n_{2}\right\rangle \rightsquigarrow\frac{e^{i\theta}}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|n_{1}+1\right\rangle \otimes\left|n_{2}\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|n_{1}\right\rangle \otimes\left|n_{2}+1\right\rangle \right)
\]

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 denotes the incoming photon.
 It also is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coherent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with respect to either oscillator, and so the Cartesian product 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 symbol is used to denote this.
 The photon absorption, indicated by the squiggly arrow 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightsquigarrow$
\end_inset

 places the two oscillators into superposition, and thus the otimes 
\begin_inset Formula $\otimes$
\end_inset

 symbol is used.
 Only one of the two oscillators can be excited, not both, so only 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{2}$
\end_inset

 can be incremented.
 There is necessarily some fixed phase 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\phi}$
\end_inset

 between these two.
 Where it comes from, I don't know.
 In a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

realistic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 model, it would arise from some detailed description of the photon–oscillator
 interaction.
 Perhaps its always the same for every photon interaction, perhaps it changes
 each time.
 The point is that the RHS is an entangled state.
 I've thrown in an extra factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\theta}$
\end_inset

 which 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

doesn't matter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the usual sense, and a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 so as to preserve normalization and minimize hand–waving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is reasonable to take the initial state to be 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}=n_{2}=0$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the ground state, and that would make the notation slightly less busy and
 verbose.
 I won't do that for now, because 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{2}$
\end_inset

 serve as useful place–holders to help track what's connected to what.
 We can set 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}=n_{2}=0$
\end_inset

 later, if desired.
 Note that for a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 system, these detector SHO's might actually be mixtures (not pure states),
 with some Boltzmann probability of not being in the ground state.
 This is in a sense inevitable, if the detector SHO's are weakly connected
 to a thermal bath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of these oscillators is coupled to it's own disjoint thermal bath,
 and so eventually, these oscillators decohere.
 Write 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|b_{1}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|b_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 for these baths.
 Weak coupling, followed by decoherence can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|n\right\rangle \times\left|b\right\rangle \mapsto\left|\left(b+n\right)^{\prime}\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

where the mapsto arrow 
\begin_inset Formula $\mapsto$
\end_inset

 indicates decoherence.
 The pure state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|n\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 appearing on the LHS gets absorbed into the bath on the RHS.
 The prime denotes that the new bath is not the same as before, and the
 plus sign indicates that the state has been ergodically mixed into the
 bath.
 We retain the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 to maintain detailed balance, i.e.
 that the total energy on LHS and RHS is the same.
 The energy in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|n\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 was mixed into the bath, raising its energy.
 The mixing can be assumed to resemble the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou type
 ergodic mixing, or something along those lines.
 The use of the Cartesian product on the LHS indicates that the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|n\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is not yet coupled to the bath; we do not want to use the tensor product
 symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\otimes$
\end_inset

 just yet, because initially, there's no coupling.
 Perhaps it would be correct to write this, instead: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|n\right\rangle \times\left|b\right\rangle \mapsto\left|n\right\rangle \otimes\left|b\right\rangle \rightrightarrows\left|\left(b+n\right)^{\prime}\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

to indicate that the pure state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|n\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 becomes entangles with the bath 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and then, over time evolves in such a way that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\left(b+n\right)^{\prime}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is the more appropriate notation.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightrightarrows$
\end_inset

 is intended to denote that the eventual state of the detector SHO might
 be some mixture of states, given by the thermal bath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The grand–total process is thus meant to be written algebraically written
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{e^{i\theta}}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|n_{1}+1\right\rangle \otimes\left|n_{2}\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|n_{1}\right\rangle \otimes\left|n_{2}+1\right\rangle \right)\times\left|b_{1}\right\rangle \times\left|b_{2}\right\rangle  & \mapsto\\
\left\{ \left[\left(\left|n_{1}+1\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{1}\right\rangle \right)\times\left(\left|n_{2}\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{2}\right\rangle \right)\right]\;,\;\left[\left(\left|n_{1}\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{1}\right\rangle \right)\times\left(\left|n_{2}+1\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{2}\right\rangle \right)\right]\right\}  & \rightrightarrows\\
\left\{ \left[\left|\left(b_{1}+n_{1}+1\right)^{\prime}\right\rangle \times\left|\left(b_{2}+n_{2}\right)^{\prime}\right\rangle \right]\;,\;\left[\left|\left(b_{1}+n_{1}\right)^{\prime}\right\rangle \times\left|\left(b_{2}+n_{2}+1\right)^{\prime}\right\rangle \right]\right\} 
\end{align*}

\end_inset

This is a verbose mess, but is not meant to to be difficult.
 As before, the mapsto arrow 
\begin_inset Formula $\mapsto$
\end_inset

 indicates the coupling of the detector SHO to it's bath, and the double
 arrow 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightrightarrows$
\end_inset

 indicates the eventual thermalization.
 As always, the Cartesian product indicates non–entangled, decoupled systems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's new here are the curly braces 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \cdots\right\} $
\end_inset

 which indicate the set of all possible worlds: the many–worlds outcome
 that is eventually attained.
 The square brackets 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\cdots\right]$
\end_inset

 denote a single world, used here to improve readability.
 For readability, set 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}=n_{2}=0$
\end_inset

, and then the two worlds become a bit more clear:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ \left[\left|\left(b_{1}+1\right)^{\prime}\right\rangle \times\left|b_{2}^{\prime}\right\rangle \right]\;,\;\left[\left|b_{1}^{\prime}\right\rangle \times\left|\left(b_{2}+1\right)^{\prime}\right\rangle \right]\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

 In one world, detector 1 has absorbed the photon, and in the other world,
 detector 2 has absorbed it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number of surprising features to the above, and so reviewing
 these and placing them into context is worthwhile.
 First, only two detectors were used; the above algebra generalizes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trivially
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to more than two.
 Next, SHO's were used as detectors, but for a realistic setup, these could
 be any quantum system that couples to light.
 Likewise, the photon was over–simplified in the above; there's no mention
 of polarization, and no explicit concern about its wavelength, other than
 that the energy should be matched to what the detector is sensitive to.
 All this is OK, because it does not seem to impact the general description.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the above is the ansatz made for the
 photon absorption.
 I did not expect this myself, but got forced into it while attempting to
 write the text.
 It is very much the case that the initial state of the two detectors must
 be a Cartesian product of two distinct, isolated, non–interacting systems.
 Of this, there's no doubt; we're not causally tracing these back to the
 Bag Bang to argue that they are secretly entangled.
 No, they're distinct.
 However, after the photon absorption, they must necessarily become entangled.
 This must also be the case, as otherwise, there is no mechanism available
 to guarantee that the photon is absorbed only once.
 We must have this, in order to have the linear logic menu–choice operator:
 either one system absorbs the photon, or the other, but not both.
 For one dollar, you get this candy–bar, or that one, but not both.
 The tensor product is the formal procedure that provides the mutual exclusion
 lock needed for wave function collapse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So this is perhaps the next surprising thing: the relationship between linear
 logic and mutex locks in software and vending machines is well–known, and
 both mutex locks and vending machines are classical objects, not quantum
 objects.
 There's no Schrodinger's candy–bar superposition between a Kit–Kat bar
 and a Snickers.
 Put the dollar in the machine, open the lid and look: you see a Kit–Kat
 bar or a Snickers; you cannot infer that they were in a quantum superposition
 before you inserted the dollar bill.
 Yet I am absolutely tickled that this classical menu–choice fragment of
 linear logic is exactly what is needed to describe the state of the system
 immediately after the photon absorption.
 Again, I repeat, cut–n–pasting the above formula: the state, after photon
 absorption, but before decoherence is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|n_{1}+1\right\rangle \otimes\left|n_{2}\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|n_{1}\right\rangle \otimes\left|n_{2}+1\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

and that is the bona–fide tensor symbol there, and bona–fide vector addition.
 This is an element of a tensor algebra.
 Its the real thing, a real quantum state, and more precisely, an entangled
 quantum state.
 The absorption of the photon entangled the two detectors.
 And, again, it seems there is no other way.
 There is no other mathematical mechanism that I know of that provides the
 required mutual exclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, perhaps, if one got into category theory more deeply, there might perhaps
 be other algebraic constructions that embed the needed menu–choice fragment
 of linear logic, and that perhaps one of these other systems could be used
 in place of the tensor product above.
 I dunno.
 It's possible, I suppose, But given that QM is firmly grounded on the ordinary
 tensor algebra, it seems pointless to hunt for other possibilities at this
 time.
 Interesting, perhaps, but not today.
 And so, for this reason, I conclude that post photon absorption, the two
 detectors must necessarily be entangled in the fashion as written above.
 I insist that this must be the case, that there's no other way, and yet
 I find it kind of surprising and amazing.
 I guess surprise and amazement is part of the territory.
 Anyway ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next noteworthy point is that these detectors can be placed in a Renninger
 arrangement: system one might be a meter away from the light source, and
 system two might be a kilometer away, or a few million light–years away.
 However distant these two detectors seem to be in the conventional Newtonian
 sense, they are at distance zero in the Minkowski metric light–cone sense.
 Although perhaps this is misleading: the above description also works if
 I replace the photon by some massive particle, e.g.
 an electron.
 The Renninger arrangement is still possible: one detector is a few centimeters
 away, the other is a few meters away in some pumped–out vacuum chamber.
 The more distant detector is strictly inside the future light–cone of the
 closer detector.
 They are time–like separated.
 And yet, despite this separation, they are entangled.
 And this is the other remarkable part of the here–and–now interpretation:
 clocks located in the lab frame, close to the locations of the detectors
 show distinct times and time ordering.
 However, the entanglement is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

here and now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I'm studiously avoiding the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

future
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

past
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because I want to reserve these words to the stuff that happened before
 here–and–now, vs the stuff that might happen after here–and–now.
 Shit.
 I need different vocabulary words to indicate the ordering, because there
 seems to be two orderings: the relative ordering arising from the (local)
 Minkowski geometry, and the ordering arising from the measurement entanglement.
 That is, the entanglement happens in the here–and–now, even though the
 two entangled systems are causally separated (for electrons) or light–like
 separated (for photons).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuck me.
 I suppose I should go off and read those Nobel–prize–winning papers from
 Clauser etal.
 because for all I know, I'm just re–inventing what they described.
 See? This is the decision problem: should I forever read what someone else
 has thought about and discovered, or should I go practice discovering things
 on my own? Well, here I am, practicing.
 Maybe this particular rock–climbing wall has been climbed before.
 Maybe not.
 Don't know.
 So it goes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So where was I? So, the next surprising thing in the development above is
 where and how many–worlds shows up as a side–effect of decoherence.
 First, the weak–coupling formula
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|n\right\rangle \times\left|b\right\rangle \mapsto\left|n\right\rangle \otimes\left|b\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

should not be controversial.
 It just says that there's a thermal bath 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and that we will use 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 to describe the state of that bath.
 In particular, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is necessarily a mixed state and so instead of writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 I should have written a mixture density operator written as a sum of states
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigcup_{s\in b}\rho\left(s\right)\left|s\right\rangle \left\langle s\right|$
\end_inset

 for some mixture density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 and the bigcup union 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigcup_{s\in b}$
\end_inset

 is used to remind us that this should be thought of as a topological set–union
 of all of the pure states 
\begin_inset Formula $s\in b$
\end_inset

.
 It's not obvious that I need to invoke density operators; I think it's
 OK to just acknowledge that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is a mixture, and, if needed to explicitly write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|b\right\rangle =\bigcup_{s\in b}\rho\left(s\right)\left|s\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

as needed to indicate that 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is just some distribution of pure states on some manifold.
 And, since we're thermalizing, its reasonable to set 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(s\right)=1$
\end_inset

 to indicate that the states are ergodically distributed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And yet, what is surprising here is that weak–coupling again takes the form
 of entanglement.
 That is, in writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|n\right\rangle \times\left|b\right\rangle \mapsto\left|n\right\rangle \otimes\left|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 we again convert a Cartesian product into a tensor product, but this time
 there's no actual photon needed to create this entanglement.
 Or rather, there was no explicit photon.
 At the micro–scale, a weak coupling between oscillators necessarily will
 entail the exchange of virtual photons, one way or another: either due
 to Brownian motion collisions in a gas, or some other statistical–mechanical
 process.
 That is, measurement is necessarily entanglement.
 Just that, earlier, we used an explicit, real photon and considered its
 absorption, vs.
 now we implicitly assume virtual photon interactions.
 So this is interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mixed–state notation implies that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|n\right\rangle \otimes\left|b\right\rangle =\bigcup_{s\in b}\rho\left(s\right)\left|n\right\rangle \otimes\left|s\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

holds at the microscopic level.
 I'm not sure what to do with this, or what it really means.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next formula that was also meant to be non–controversial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|n\right\rangle \otimes\left|b\right\rangle \rightrightarrows\left|\left(b+n\right)^{\prime}\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

but is this really valid? This was meant to denote the thermalization of
 state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|n\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 but the set–union notation indicates difficulty.
 That is, the time evolution is supposed to be given in the Schrodinger
 picture as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iEt}$
\end_inset

 so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left|n\left(t\right)\right\rangle  & =e^{-iE_{n}t}\left|n\left(0\right)\right\rangle \\
\left|s\left(t\right)\right\rangle  & =e^{-iE_{s}t}\left|s\left(0\right)\right\rangle \\
\bigcup_{s\in b}\rho\left(s\right)\left|n\left(t\right)\right\rangle \otimes\left|s\left(t\right)\right\rangle  & =\bigcup_{s\in b}\rho\left(s\right)e^{-i\left(E_{n}+E_{s}\right)t}\left|n\left(0\right)\right\rangle \otimes\left|s\left(0\right)\right\rangle 
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and I'm not sure if this is supposed to be the textbook–standard description
 of thermalization.
 It doesn't quite feel right.
 When I was a kid, my education did not include any formal development of
 mixed states.
 Instead, it was some hand–waving:

oh, its what you get if you run the same experiment over and over
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the set–union notation was not used, but it could be reasonably inferred:
 the mixture is just the union of all repetitions of re–running the experiment.
 Later on, I did eventually realize why the density of states 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 is a real number, and not a complex number, and that it represents a probabilit
y distribution, not a phase or amplitude.
 What's more, the pure states 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 correspond to single points on some manifold, and so mixtures were just
 some distributions of points on a manifold.
 This is clean and clear–cut, and seems to be straight–forward interpretationall
y.
 So why am I balking?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, for one, the time evolution 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-i\left(E_{n}+E_{s}\right)t}$
\end_inset

 is unitary, whereas I was expecting something dissipative.
 Am I supposed to write 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(s,t\right)$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 with the understanding that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(s,t\right)$
\end_inset

 is some ergodic process, possibly some Markovian process, maybe even necessaril
y Markovian? I don't know.
 If this is the case, this is far outside of anything I've read about, before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other reason that I'm balking is that ...
 wait for it ...
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigcup_{s\in b}$
\end_inset

 sure–as–hell feels like a set–union over many–worlds.
 That is, each 
\begin_inset Formula $s\in b$
\end_inset

 is a single world, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 is the probability of being in that single world, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigcup_{s\in b}$
\end_inset

 is just the collection of them.
 Very strangely, very unexpectedly, this fits with the naive hand–waving
 description of a mixed state as the union of a repeated collection of experimen
ts.
 Because, duh.
 We ran Stern–Gerlach once, got spin up, ran it a second time, got spin–down
 and each single run of the experiment, each single sodium atom flying through
 those magnets, each one of these was a single world, a single experiment,
 and the union of all of these, the splatter of a trillion sodium atoms
 on that glass plate forming two distinct spots, that's of course the mixture,
 that's what we meant by mixture.
 But fuck me if 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigcup_{s\in b}$
\end_inset

 isn't a union over many worlds.
 This is ...
 unexpected and surprising.
 I suppose some future reader of this text is thinking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yeah, and its also wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but if it's wrong, I do not yet see how.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is a thermal bath, it can also be called a canonical ensemble.
 So that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigcup_{s\in b}$
\end_inset

 is an enumeration over all states in the canonical ensemble.
 And 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(s\right)\sim e^{-E/kT}$
\end_inset

 is the weighting.
 But I don't know how to make ends meet, here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This brings us to the one statement that does seem problematic, and is central
 to the development above.
 Set 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}=n_{2}=0$
\end_inset

 and ignore normalization and overall phase to write the prior collapse
 formula as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left(\left|1\right\rangle \otimes\left|0\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|1\right\rangle \right)\times\left|b_{1}\right\rangle \times\left|b_{2}\right\rangle  & \mapsto\\
\left\{ \left[\left(\left|1\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{1}\right\rangle \right)\times\left(\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{2}\right\rangle \right)\right]\;,\;\left[\left(\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{1}\right\rangle \right)\times\left(\left|1\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{2}\right\rangle \right)\right]\right\} 
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Here, the many–worlds interpretation manifests very specifically: there
 are two experimental outcomes: in one outcome, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\left|1\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{1}\right\rangle \right)\times\left(\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{2}\right\rangle \right)$
\end_inset

 is explicitly observed, and in the other outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{1}\right\rangle \right)\times\left(\left|1\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{2}\right\rangle \right)$
\end_inset

 is observed, and these are the only two outcomes possible.
 Each experimental outcome is equally likely, and so we write 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(0\times1\right)=\rho\left(1\times0\right)=1/2$
\end_inset

 and so if we repeat the the experiment a trillion times, it is to be written
 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|SG\right\rangle =\rho\left(1\times0\right)\left[\left(\left|1\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{1}\right\rangle \right)\times\left(\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{2}\right\rangle \right)\right]\;\cup\;\rho\left(0\times1\right)\left[\left(\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{1}\right\rangle \right)\times\left(\left|1\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{2}\right\rangle \right)\right]
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|SG\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is the **mixed** state representing the outcome of running Stern–Gerlach
 a trillion times, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{1}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is where the sodium atom hits the glass plate in the upper half, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is where the sodium atom does NOT hit in the lower half, because there
 is only one sodium atom, so if it hits high, then the world, the outcome
 of a single–sodium–atom experiment is necessarily 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\left|1\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{1}\right\rangle \right)\times\left(\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|b_{2}\right\rangle \right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And, from this, we get that the earlier notation of using 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \cdots\right\} $
\end_inset

 to be the **set** of all possible measurement outcomes is really the same
 thing as a mixed state, with only the practical different being that we
 also use 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 to assign a probability to each outcome.
 Oh, and if we were only to be a bit more careful in our notation, we should
 eventually discover that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(s\right)=\left|\psi\left(s\right)\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 but I've been too sloppy in my notation to be able to jump to that conclusion
 just yet.
 But that conclusion seems inevitable, so I'm not to worried.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So this has been a lot of work and effort, and what have we learned, exactly?
 First, that we have a notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightsquigarrow$
\end_inset

 and also 
\begin_inset Formula $\mapsto$
\end_inset

 that both represent the process of entanglement.
 In the former case, we write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma\times\left|a\right\rangle \times\left|b\right\rangle \rightsquigarrow c_{1}\left|a^{\prime}\right\rangle \otimes\left|b^{\prime}\right\rangle +c_{2}\left|a^{\prime\prime}\right\rangle \otimes\left|b^{\prime\prime}\right\rangle +\cdots
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is some specific real on–mass–shell particle that is absorbed.
 As before, the Cartesian product on the LHS denotes that the distinct systems
 can be treated as being distinct, non–interacting, thermally isolated,
 etc.
 The tensor product on the RHS is meant to denote a bonafide tensor product,
 so that the squiggly arrow 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightsquigarrow$
\end_inset

 is understood to be the quotienting of Cartesian products modulo some bilinear
 form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},c_{2},\cdots$
\end_inset

 are understood to be some complex numbers, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi^{\prime}\right\rangle ,\left|\psi^{\prime\prime}\right\rangle ,\cdots$
\end_inset

 some collection of states.
 The entanglement has no specific location in space or time, which is the
 point of the Renninger arrangement.
 The location of here–and–now is the collection of points in space–time
 where the RHS is non–zero.
 For the most part, we want here–and–now to have compact support, but the
 lesson from cosmology is that the last photon decoupling from the CMB,
 and the last neutrino decoupling from nucleosynthesis participates in the
 here–and–now, if you are so unlucky as to perceive a CMB photon (or neutrino,
 as the case may be).
 The point is that here–end–now is localized in space–time, but not in the
 conventional sense of some Hamiltonian space–like surface.
 Phew.
 I marvel at this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightsquigarrow$
\end_inset

 operation meant to be the conventional quotient used to construct tensor
 spaces from products of vector spaces.
 Lets recall the textbook definition.
 Just to be very specific and concrete here: for ordinary vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{2}$
\end_inset

 the tensor product 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}\otimes v_{2}$
\end_inset

 is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{1}\otimes v_{2}=v_{1}\times v_{2}\mod\,b\left(u,w\right)
\]

\end_inset

where mod is modulo, and 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(u,w\right)$
\end_inset

 is the bilinear form obeying 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(cu,w\right)=b\left(u,cw\right)=cb\left(u,w\right)$
\end_inset

 and also 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(u+v,w\right)=b\left(u,w\right)+b\left(v,w\right)$
\end_inset

 and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(u,v+w\right)=b\left(u,v\right)+b\left(u,w\right)$
\end_inset

 for all scalars 
\begin_inset Formula $c\in\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 in the real or complex field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 and vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $u,v,w$
\end_inset

 in the vector spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{2}$
\end_inset

 as appropriate.
 In particular, this implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}\otimes v_{2}$
\end_inset

 is a coset: it is a collection of all Cartesian pairs of the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
v_{1}\otimes v_{2} & =\left\{ \left(u,w\right):\forall_{c\in\mathbb{K}}u=cv_{1}\mbox{ and }w=v_{2}/c\right\} \\
 & =\bigcup_{c\in\mathbb{K}}\left\{ \left(cv_{1},v_{2}/c\right)\right\} 
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and so on for the remaining bilinearity relations.
 Look them up.
 Notice how the second form is written as a set union.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm belaboring the above because I want to point out that the absorption
 of the particle 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 creates a tensor space, and that space is not just one point, but a splattering
, an algebraic variety: insofar as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(v_{1},v_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 is a single point in the Cartesian space 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}\times V_{2}$
\end_inset

, the tensor product 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}\otimes v_{2}$
\end_inset

 is some algebraic variety in 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}\times V_{2}$
\end_inset

 where all points in that variety are taken to be equivalent, i.e.
 given by the equivalence relation defined by the bilinear form.
 So the absorption of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 causes a single point in the Cartesian space to shatter into a surface.
 Alternately, the absorption of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 causes a surface in the Cartesian space to condense or contract into an
 equivalence.
 Take your pick.
 It's a quotienting modulo operation.

\begin_layout Standard
There's more: the use of the set–union notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigcup_{c\in\mathbb{K}}$
\end_inset

 is supposed to imbue the proceedings with a many–worlds–ish interpretation,
 as noted many paragraphs earlier.
 I think 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

imbue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the right word, because we're glossing over some important details:
 what's the topology? What's the quotient topology? Do I give these spaces
 a measure? How? Which one? The tensor product of two algebraic varieties
 is again an algebraic variety, at least, if you do it correctly with the
 appropriate category–theoretic definition and also the Zariski topology,
 which is NOT the standard topology, but is very weird (its not Hausdorff,
 for starters.) And these days, you shouldn't say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

algebraic variety
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 without also saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

scheme
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but it hardly seems like this should need to enter the conversation here....
 or should it? I can't tell.
 I can't make any case that it shouldn't.
 So, in this sense, imagining tensor spaces to be kind–of–like algebraic
 varieties is kind–of wrong.
 But this needs to be articulated more carefully, and I can't do that today.

 This is the canonical example of homogeneous coordinates that appears at

The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mapsto$

 does the same thing, but it does not involve any explicit particle

 If this was perturbation theory, this could be treated as an interaction:
 some exchange of virtual particles, possibly with loop diagrams to your

 It doesn't have to be perturbative, its just again, a map of the form

However, there is another difference between these two, and it requires
 using the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

eigenstate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which, until now, I've somehow managed to avoid saying.
 The time has come, I guess.
 The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mapsto$
\end_inset

 has a distributive property that needs to be stated more explicitly.
 It is a abstraction of the earlier form:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left(\left|a\right\rangle \otimes\left|b\right\rangle +\left|c\right\rangle \otimes\left|d\right\rangle \right)\times\left|e\right\rangle  & \mapsto\\
\rho\left(a,b,e\right)\left[\left|a\right\rangle \otimes\left|b\right\rangle \otimes\left|e\right\rangle \right]\;\cup\;\rho\left(c,d,e\right)\left[\left|c\right\rangle \otimes\left|d\right\rangle \otimes\left|e\right\rangle \right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where the square brackets 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\cdots\right]$
\end_inset

 are interpreted as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

single world
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the union 
\begin_inset Formula $\cup$
\end_inset

 is interpreted ambiguously as a collection of many worlds or a mixed state.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eigenstate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 enters the game here, because the LHS above only makes sense insofar as
 the states 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 etc are eigenstates of some operator, presumable an operator that commutes
 with the Hamiltonian, or something like that.
 That, together with the idea that states like 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|d\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 are going to be spatially separated, so eigenstates of the position operator,
 roughly speaking.
 And all these various operators might not commute, which adds to the confusion.
 At any rate, this distributive property seems to be the Born rule, in some
 kind of fancy, unfamiliar clothing.
 Or something like that.

At this point, I'm tired and have to wrap it up.
 I've discovered a whole new treasure–trove of things to get confused about.
 Still, some kind of forward progress seems to have been made.
 The general concept of entanglement seems to have been pinned down a bit
 more carefully.
 The general concept of collapse seems to have been shown to be the same
 thing as entanglement, but different.
 I seem to have an argument that mixed states are the same thing as many–worlds,
 but it's not clear that this has altered any philosophical positions in
 the slightest.
 The structure of the distributive property remains too cloudy to say more.

While falling asleep, I noticed that cryptocurrencies try to find hashing
 algos that result in a block of zeros: they are doing a kind of modulo

 That mixes inputs from all over the place.
 That's ergodic and mixing.
 And puts results onto an unchangeable blockchain.
 The history.
 So maybe, but analogy, Bostrom's Simulation Hypothesis says we live on

The other after–thought I had about the above was the need to clarify how/why
 the coupling to a thermal bath results in decoherence.
 That is, a naive thought is that the coupling to the baths
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\left|1\right\rangle \otimes\left|0\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|1\right\rangle \right)\times\left|b_{1}\right\rangle \times\left|b_{2}\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

could have resulted in the entanglement of the baths.
 And maybe it does.
 For a little while.
 But then, the ergodic evolution of the baths eventually breaks that entanglemen
t.
 And it does so in finite time, a characteristic mixing time or diffusion
 time.
 So the bath coupling, and the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mapsto$
\end_inset

 is a bit of sleight of hand.
 That is, up above, I defined 
\begin_inset Formula $\mapsto$
\end_inset

 to be wave function collapse, by definition, so, of course, nothing remains
 to be done after doing so.
 This is not entirely satisfactory.

The point of bath entanglement is the old one, from months/years ago where
 I blurble onwards about interferometer diamonds.
 That is, it is possible that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{2}$
\end_inset

 get entangled, and stay that way, until some future date when 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{2}$
\end_inset

 are brought together again, into the same nearby location in space–time,
 and compared: only then is it absolutely mandatory that consistent histories
 be observable.
 There's no specific demand for consistent histories before then.
 And the lack of this demand is why I blurbled that these interferometric
 diamonds are so important.
 So it seems that is the question facing us, for now: do thermal baths get
 entangled, or not? Common sense says that baths cause decoherenece.
 But I do not yet understand how that works.
 And I guess nobody does, because otherwise, we wouldn't be wasting hot
 air talking about unitary evolution.
 Whatever.

 a personal take, ignoring what scholars in the field have done before.
 Why am I so constantly defensive in my posture? I know.
 Because this is a psychological self–protection mechanism.
 I feel as if I am always dismissed, that nothing and no one cares or is
 interested.
 I live in a little isolated bubble, ineffective, unattached, non–interacting.
 So let it go both ways: they ignore me; I ignore them.
 Weakly.
 A weak interaction, only.
 So with that disclaimer as to the nature of the easily–dismissed unimportant
 silliness that is to follow, we begin our journey around the garden path.

\begin_layout Standard
The simple harmonic oscillator.
 
\begin_inset Formula $H=\hbar\omega\left(a^{\dagger}a+1/2\right)$
\end_inset

 with states 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|0\right\rangle ,\left|1\right\rangle ,\cdots$
\end_inset

 Consider two of them, labelled 1 and 2, with an interaction Hamiltonian
 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{int}=\epsilon\left(a_{2}^{\dagger}a_{1}+a_{1}^{\dagger}a_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 for some small number 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\ll\hbar\omega$
\end_inset

.
 The task is to diagonalize the Hamiltonian.
 To keep with the above, the first oscillator will be the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

detector
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, while the second one will be part of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thermal bath
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We'll add more to the bath, but for now, just these two.
 Initially, bot are in the ground state, and nothing interesting.
 The interesting case is to pump the first oscillator, and watch the time
 dynamics.
 But, before that, lets diagonalize, to see what the long–time steady–state
 is.
 For this, lets simplify; we know the system will never have more than one
 quantum of energy, so ignore the states 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|2\right\rangle ,\left|3\right\rangle ,\cdots$
\end_inset

 and create a vector basis for the Cartesian product 
\begin_inset Formula $SHO_{1}\times SHO_{2}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
e_{1} & =\left|0\right\rangle \times\left|0\right\rangle \\
e_{2} & =\left|1\right\rangle \times\left|0\right\rangle \\
e_{3} & =\left|0\right\rangle \times\left|1\right\rangle \\
e_{4} & =\left|1\right\rangle \times\left|1\right\rangle 
\end{align*}

\end_inset

As noted, the Cartesian product is only appropriate for non–interacting,
 thermally isolated systems, so if they are going to interact, the very
 first thing we do is to write the tensor product 
\begin_inset Formula $\otimes$
\end_inset

 instead.
 The Hamiltonian in this basis is, in matrix form, a 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times4$
\end_inset

 matrix, is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
1\\
 & 2 & \epsilon\\
 & \epsilon & 2\\
 &  &  & 3
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

so the ground state has energy 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}=1$
\end_inset

 and note that one can write both 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1}=\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and also 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1}=\left|0\right\rangle \times\left|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 because the interaction term never couples to the ground state.
 In particular, this means that the state 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1}=\left|0\right\rangle \times\left|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 can have two distinct phases 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\phi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\phi_{2}}$
\end_inset

 that are entirely independent of one–another, whereas the tensor state
 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1}=\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 can only have one phase 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\phi}$
\end_inset

 by bilinearity.
 Now, for this simplified model, none of this matters at all.
 Nor, in general, do overall phases matter ...
 except in one case: the Bohm–Aharonov effect.
 So one can imagine some different variant of this thought experiment, having
 some magnetic field, and having some setup where Cartesian products or
 not, phase differences, matter.
 So, for the present case, having 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thermally isolated, non–interacting ground states
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 suggests that 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1}=\left|0\right\rangle \times\left|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is the correct notation, but this is kind of meaningless, for the current
 setup, because there's no way to tell.
 The experimental setups are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

philosophically indistinguishable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: we can't tell these two cases apart.
 Enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first excited state has energy 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{3}{2}=\frac{3}{2}+\frac{1}{2}=2$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=0$
\end_inset

 case and for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\ne0$
\end_inset

 case we have the block diagonal
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2 & \epsilon\\
\epsilon & 2
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

which has eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $0=\det\left(H-\lambda I\right)$
\end_inset

 given by the characteristic equation 
\begin_inset Formula $0=\left(2-\lambda\right)^{2}-\epsilon^{2}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $0=\lambda^{2}-4\lambda+4-\epsilon^{2}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda=\frac{4\pm\sqrt{16-4\left(4-\epsilon^{2}\right)}}{2}=2\pm\epsilon
\]

\end_inset

What the heck does this even mean? As I adiabatically switch on an interaction
 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 the system gets a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

line splitting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, where one state has slightly higher energy than the other.
 How the heck did this happen? I had two SHO's, and wanted to consider the
 case where one or the other is excited, but not both, and of course they're
 coupled, duh, but line splitting? Really?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, what are the eigenvectors? That's easy:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{-}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
-1
\end{array}\right]\;\mbox{ and }\;v_{+}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
1
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

so if we adiabatically increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 up from zero, we expect the system to eventually thermalize into the 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{-}$
\end_inset

 state in the laboratory frame.
 Maybe.
 What is the meaning of 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{+}$
\end_inset

? Well, if we really are adiabatic, then there is some chance that the system
 settles into the 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{+}$
\end_inset

 state.
 It could happen.
 This is the wrong time to start hand–waving about thermodynamics, but if
 we did so, then there would be a canonical ensemble (a mixed state) with
 both 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{-}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{+}$
\end_inset

 populated with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-E_{\pm}/kT}$
\end_inset

 but it is too early to do such hand–waving.
 Maybe later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The initial state, just after the detector SHO detects, is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e_{2}=\left|1\right\rangle \otimes\left|0\right\rangle =\left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
0
\end{array}\right]=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(v_{-}+v_{+}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and the time evolution of this is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e_{2}\left(t\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(e^{-iE_{-}t}v_{-}+e^{-iE_{+}t}v_{+}\right)
\]

\end_inset

or, writing 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\pm}=2\pm\epsilon=E_{0}\pm E_{int}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
e_{2}\left(t\right) & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}e^{-iE_{0}t}\left(e^{+iE_{int}t}v_{-}+e^{-iE_{int}t}v_{+}\right)\\
 & =\frac{e^{-iE_{0}t}}{2}\left[\begin{array}{c}
e^{-iE_{int}t}+e^{+iE_{int}t}\\
e^{-iE_{int}t}-e^{+iE_{int}t}
\end{array}\right]\\
 & =e^{-iE_{0}t}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\cos E_{int}t\\
-i\sin E_{int}t
\end{array}\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and so if we later 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (whatever the fuck that means) the second SHO, by applying the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measurement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 projection
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{B}=e_{2}\left(0\right)e_{2}^{\dagger}\left(0\right)=\left[\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|1\right\rangle \right]\left[\left\langle 0\right|\otimes\left\langle 1\right|\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

then there is a beat frequency:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|P_{B}e_{2}\left(t\right)\right|^{2}=\frac{1}{4}\left|e^{-iE_{int}t}-e^{+iE_{int}t}\right|^{2}=\sin^{2}E_{int}t
\]

\end_inset

and so one could say that energy is flowing into and out of the second oscillato
r with the beat frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{int}=E_{int}/\hbar$
\end_inset

 after reinserting 
\begin_inset Formula $\hbar=1$
\end_inset

.
 This is 100% analogous to the college freshman examples of beat frequencies
 in AM modulation and whatever it is that are being demonstrated.
 Except that here, we have to use our imagination for a thought experiment
 where it is possible to isolate the the second oscillator, and measure
 the likelihood of it being in some excited state.
 The problem here is two–fold: the need to imagine measuring, when the whole
 point of this essay is to figure out what it means to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The second problem is we want to eventually arrive at decoherence, where
 there is no more of this beat–frequency stuff, but instead a canonical
 ensemble, where, in half of the members of that ensemble have the second
 oscillator in the excited state, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

decoherence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that the time dependence has been lost.
 So all this verbiage is a statement that we're not done yet, there's more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in the present case, is to add more oscillators to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bath
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 As before, we want a weak coupling 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{int}\ll H_{0}$
\end_inset

 but now we have a choice for how the oscillators are to be interconnected.
 We could arrange them into a linear chain, a la Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou
 geometry.
 We could arrange them on a hub–n–spoke model.
 Which seems less interesting but possible.
 We could arrange them on some random graph, with edges representing pair–wise
 interactions.
 What's more, the interactions could be of varying strength.
 The connectivity of the graph 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

determines
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the shape of space.
 Clearly, a chain is one–dimensional, and 2D and 3D lattices, likewise.
 Random graphs are of indeterminate dimension, usually some high dimension.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implies that the dimension of space is fixed not by Newton, Minkowski
 or Einstein, but rather the connectivity of the nodes in the thermal bath.
 Given mean–field results, we know that generically, 1D systems do not have
 phase transitions, while 2D and 3D systems do, and have complex dynamics,
 in general.
 We also know that systems in higher dimensions can be described by mean–fields.
 This leads to a freaky hypothesis: is space three–dimensional, because
 there is a phase transition between lower and higher dimensions, at the
 boundary between chaotic and mean–field results? This sounds insane from
 any other perspective, but if the goal is to build a thermal bath of SHO's
 with weak interactions, then the behavior of that network, of that bath,
 is going to be determined by the network connectivity of the SHO's in that
 bath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an advanced question that I am not prepared to tackle at this time.
 Well, but still, a few short comments are in order.
 The solutions to the Schrodinger equation in 3D give exact results for
 the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, and this would not hold in 2D or 4D,
 ergo space is 3D.
 The solutions to the propagator for the D'Alambertian are exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta^{4}\left(x-ct\right)$
\end_inset

 and this would not work in any other dimension.
 So, in this sense, we 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

know
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 space is N–dimensional for N=3 an integer.
 What about non–integral dimensions? Like 
\begin_inset Formula $N=3+\epsilon$
\end_inset

, for some small but indeterminate 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 it is stochastic, and whose expectation value is zero? First, we don't
 really know how to write a Schrodinger equation for this situation: it
 would require writing down a second–quantized theory, aka QFT for a random
 network of points, with nearest–neighbor interactions that resemble the
 D'Alembertian when suitably coarse–grained.
 i.e.
 when taking some expectation value over nearest–neighbor interactions.
 So this random network is imagined to happen 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

at the Planck scale
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so that by the time we get to hydrogen–atom scale, space really does average
 out to an expectation value that looks 3D.
 FWIW, I see no particular issues with Dirac spinors, either: one can define
 a Clifford algebra at each point on the network, build Weyl spinors on
 points, and then have pairwise interactions between them, that, when coarse
 grained, end up being Dirac spinors.
 Would it be possible to derive the Einstein Field Equations as the expectation
 value of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thermal bath
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of weakly interacting oscillators, poised at the critical point between
 hard–chaos in 3D and mean–field theory in 
\begin_inset Formula $3+\epsilon$
\end_inset

 dimensions? I dunno.
 This is not out of bounds.
 It could be wrong, but it certainly is something that could be analyzed,
 simulated, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, but it is out–of–bounds for today's efforts.
 We are lacking in the sophistication to make progress.
 So lets step back a bit, and go through some simpler cases first.
 Specifically, we want several things: two thermal baths, initially isolated
 from each other, but then connected with a single Renninger–style wave–collapse
 entanglement thingy, as described above, and a demonstration that such
 an entanglement gives us Born–rule type probabilities, and Mott–problem
 type coherence/decoherence.
 That needs to remaind the focus, before getting nebulous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So consider first a 1D chain of SHO's, weak interaction, pumped so that
 only one excitation is on the chain, so that we can ignore the case of
 more than one excitation.
 The low–brow matrix representation is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
2 & \epsilon\\
\epsilon & 2 & \epsilon\\
 & \epsilon & 2 & \ddots\\
 &  & \ddots & \ddots
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

'th row/column corresponds to the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

'th SHO being in an excited state.
 As before, 
\begin_inset Formula $2=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{3}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This tri–diagonal matrix is the block submatrix of the high–brow expression
 for a 1D chain of SHO's
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
H & =H_{0}+H_{int}\\
 & =\sum_{i=1}^{N}\hbar\left(a_{i}^{\dagger}a_{i}+\frac{1}{2}\right)+\epsilon\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}a_{i+1}^{\dagger}a_{i}+a_{i}^{\dagger}a_{i+1}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The single–excitation matrix basis has 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 basis vectors
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
e_{1} & =\left|1\right\rangle \otimes\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\cdots\otimes\left|0\right\rangle \\
e_{2} & =\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|1\right\rangle \otimes\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\cdots\otimes\left|0\right\rangle \\
\vdots\\
e_{N} & =\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\cdots\otimes\left|1\right\rangle 
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and, as before, we imagine that it is somehow possible to somehow 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 each of these oscillators individually, even though, as before, the concept
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measurement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 remains ambiguous.
 To remove some ambiguity, one kind of measurement involves using conventional
 algebra to write expressions that belong to some tensor algebra which is
 used to make formal algebraic statements about the bath.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measurements
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are simply the conventional algebraic manipulations associated with conventiona
l bra-ket notation and conventional tensor algebra stuff.
 Lets call this the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bath algebra measurement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is distinct from the Renninger entanglement that is the intended topic,
 which I guess we can still call the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave function collapse measurement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I'm trying to draw a distinct boundary here, to avoid later confusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 are well–known, and follow from the fact that the tri–diagonal form 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

looks like
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a (scaled) 1D Laplacian plus a (scaled) identity matrix.
 The solutions arise via roots–of–unity type manipulations, with the eigenvector
s
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{k}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{N}\left(j-1\right)\right)e_{j}
\]

\end_inset

and the eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{k}=2+\epsilon\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{N}\right)
\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=0,\cdots,N-1$
\end_inset

.
 I think I got that right.
 I'm doing this from memory.
 Seems to check out.
 Hope I didn't blow this.
 So, as before, line splitting, a bunch of closely spaced levels.
 Beat–frequency stuff, if I look at only one oscillator.
 Requires hand–waving to get a canonical ensemble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, lets do some of the hand–waving.
 If we start with the system in the ground state, and then hit 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1}$
\end_inset

 with a hammer, then write 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1}$
\end_inset

 as an expansion in the 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

 we find that the energy is distributed across all modes 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

 via an equipartition theorem.
 I'm too lazy to verify this, its boring algebra.
 However, none of the modes 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

are interacting and so the system will just do its version of Poincare recurrenc
e, without thermalizing.
 That is, we distinguish ergodic and mixing: roughly speaking, the wave–modes
 are ergodic, but not mixing.
 I'm not sure of what the precise definition is for ergodicity for waves,
 but I think this is correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this analysis is extremely shallow, and is also unsurprising.
 Compare, for example to the resonant wave interactions in the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–
Tsingou problem.
 The obvious question then is: given 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 SHO's, and pair–wise interactions of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{int}=\epsilon a_{i}^{\dagger}a_{j}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\ne j$
\end_inset

 is there ever any kind of network of interactions that is not diagonalizable?
 Insofar as the single–phonon excitation mode (the sub-block of the Hamiltonian)
 can be written as a matrix, an 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times N$
\end_inset

 matrix, a Hermitian one at that, then we know it is always diagonalizable
 with real eigenvalues.
 The only ambiguity that can arise is when some of the eigenvalues are degenerat
e; then these could be imagined to lead to mixing.
 But to actually get this, we need connectivity so that there's some non–trivial
 dispersion relation for the modes 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

 and the corresponding energy of those modes 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{k}$
\end_inset

 that works in analogy to a resonant interaction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And this is where my knowledge of graph theory hits the end of the line:
 are there any graphs at all, random, on a lattice, whatever, that have
 a resonant interaction? I studied the preprint A route to thermalization
 in the α-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam system, Miguel Onorato, Lara Vozella, Davide
 Proment, Yuri V.
 Lvov https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1603 carefully, back in Sept 2020 and added
 a huge chunk to the FPUT article, and also wrote the wiki page for resonant
 interaction.
 So I get all that.
 What I don't know is whether one can have resonant interactions on random
 graphs that encode the single–phonon couplings of SHO's on those graphs.
 If so, then bingo, we've got an answer.
 If not, then what about two, three or more phonons? If we do have resonant
 interactions, than what can be said about which graphs allow them, and
 which ones do not? Is there some phase–transition between the graphs that
 support thermalization, ad the ones that do not?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is fascinating! I will hypothesize that, yes, there is such a phase
 transition, and I suppose several of them: between 1D and higher–dim lattices,
 and then again, another one between those and the mean–field regime.
 And these questions are quite precise: I am no longer hand–waving here:
 We've got a specific Hamiltonian, 
\begin_inset Formula $H=H_{0}+H_{int}$
\end_inset

 exactly of the form written above, and we've got a very specific question:
 what's the dispersion relation? Wowza! this is fucking awesome, because
 it's concrete, and does not require speculation.
 Well, it does require actually answering the question, which might be hard.
 And there's some chance that I'll be disappointed by the answer? Still,
 hard to see how: arranging for degenerate eigenvalues is not hard, and
 then associating some wave–vector–like modes that have the appearance of
 propagating should not be hard...
 unless these are all 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bound modes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

free modes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but it seems like free modes would be the most common case here, since
 I'm already in the fourrier regime, because that is what diagonalizing
 a matrix means.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So lets imagine that thermalization is possible, in the form described above.
 Where does that leave us? We have two baths.
 Both are in the ground state.
 We entangle them by hitting them with a single photon, that entangles a
 single–phonon excitation in one bath, or in the other bath.
 We can use this single–photon entanglement to write a combined matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $H=H_{A}+H_{B}+H_{tangle}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{B}$
\end_inset

 are the two thermalizing baths, and 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{tangle}$
\end_inset

 is the single–photon Renninger–arrangement entanglement.
 And I bet dollars to donuts that 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{tangle}$
\end_inset

 because it is just a single graph edge, does not allow thermalization to
 occur between 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{B}$
\end_inset

 so that if one of these two is excited, then the other cannot be.
 And since the thermalization is irrevocable, this is the fundamental process
 for wave–function collapse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is still one part that is still confusing ...
 if only one, or the other can accept the phonon, then which one gets it?
 How does the bifurcation actually work? Once set in motion, I understand
 it thermalizes, but before that, how ...
 ??? I cannot yet find words for whatever it is that is confusing me here.
 Anyway, time for a dinner break.
 So ...
 later dude.
 This is fascinating.
 Feels like another step, this time a large step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
24 May 2025 Later
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, see, here's the problem.
 The above describes a plausible method for creating quantum systems that
 thermalize, using non–relativistic QM in the lab frame in the Hamiltonian
 picture.
 So how do I hook that up to Renninger? To recap: I now have two systems,
 two thermalizing systems, described by Hamiltonians 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{B}$
\end_inset

, such that when I hit one specific detector SHO, the energy of that hit
 will get mixed.
 By convention, call the thing getting thermalized a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

phonon
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, just to give it a distinct name.
 That is, systems A and B start in the ground state (zero phonons), and
 when detector A or detector B, creating a single phonon 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{A}^{\dagger}:\left|0_{A}\right\rangle \mapsto\left|1_{A}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{B}^{\dagger}:\left|0_{B}\right\rangle \mapsto\left|1_{B}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, then after some time passes in the lab frame of A and B, that phonon will
 get thermalized, per the process described/hypothesized above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vocabulary that I want to use for the Renninger state is to say that
 there is a single photon 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 that is absorbed, and it creates a specific superposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1_{A}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1_{B}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 This was given several days ago, so let me repeat in the updated notation:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma\times\left|0_{A}\right\rangle \times\left|0_{B}\right\rangle \rightsquigarrow\frac{e^{i\theta}}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|1_{A}\right\rangle \otimes\left|0_{B}\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|0_{A}\right\rangle \otimes\left|1_{B}\right\rangle \right)
\]

\end_inset

where, again, as before, the LHS uses the Cartesian product to indicate
 that the systems on the LHS are not yet entangled, while those on the RHS
 are.
 This presents a notational difficulty.
 I would like to write an interaction Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{\rightsquigarrow}$
\end_inset

 but the two different products are problematic.
 I think the Cartesian product on the LHS needs to be interpreted as a mixed
 state, so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|0_{A}\right\rangle \times\left|0_{B}\right\rangle =\bigcup_{\phi_{A},\phi_{B}}e^{i\phi_{A}}e^{i\phi_{B}}\left|0_{A}\right\rangle \otimes\left|0_{B}\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

Of these two phases, only one matters, so write 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{AB}=\phi_{B}-\phi_{A}$
\end_inset

 and just drop the other one.
 Well, maybe.
 Lets not drop things too soon.
 The set union 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigcup$
\end_inset

 notation can be dropped in favor of a measure–theoretic density 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 and I use the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 because I want to reserve the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 for later, because maybe a density matrix will be required.
 Maybe.
 The density is meant to be uniform, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, I think that the notion of a Cartesian product of two isolated, thermally
 non–interacting systems can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left|0_{A}\right\rangle \times\left|0_{B}\right\rangle  & =\int d\mu_{A}d\mu_{B}\,e^{i\left(\phi_{A}+\phi_{B}\right)}\left|0_{A}\right\rangle \otimes\left|0_{B}\right\rangle \\
 & =\int d\mu_{A}d\mu_{B}\,e^{i\left(\phi_{A}+\phi_{B}\right)}\left|0_{A},0_{B}\right\rangle 
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where the second line just simplifies the tensor notation.
 This should now be enough to write the photon wave–function collapse into
 a phonon in A or a phonon in B in operator form.
 It is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{\rightsquigarrow}=\frac{e^{i\theta}}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|0_{\gamma},1_{A},0_{B}\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|0_{\gamma},0_{A},1_{B}\right\rangle \right)\int d\mu_{A}d\mu_{B}\,e^{i\left(\phi_{A}+\phi_{B}\right)}\left\langle 1_{\gamma},0_{A},0_{B}\right|
\]

\end_inset

Perhaps there also needs to be an integral over 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 – I'm confused by this, for the moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would like to call this 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\rightsquigarrow}$
\end_inset

 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

interaction Hamiltonian
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but this is dangerous, because there's a problem with time at this stage
 of the game.
 Although both systems A and B are thermal in their respective lab frame,
 they could be flying past each other at relativistic speeds at the time
 that the interaction 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\rightsquigarrow}$
\end_inset

 takes place, and worse, the Renninger setup means one of them could be
 far in the future of the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are multiple things to be confused about, here.
 First: is the thermalization fast, or slow? That is, the photon wave-packet
 has a finite size: when this hits the two detector SHO's, is that wave–packet
 done and gone before thermalization starts? Or is the thermalization an
 ongoing process, even as the photon is still driving one or the other oscillato
rs? I guess that perhaps this is the core question of the entanglement of
 the baths, and the relation to collapse.
 Or is it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I keep saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

entanglement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1_{A}\right\rangle \otimes\left|0_{B}\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|0_{A}\right\rangle \otimes\left|1_{B}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is clearly entangled.
 But it does not seem to cause the baths to entangle.
 Lets say it is system B that is in the Renninger future.
 Lets say that it is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1_{B}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 that thermallizes.
 I want to use this to solve the analog of the Mott problem and argue that
 back–when, system A remained in the ground state.
 So that this here–and–now entanglement correctly resolves the state of
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in the past
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the state of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in the future
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, although the Renninger setup says that actually, both of these are in
 the here–and–now.
 I feel like I am chasing my own tail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets try again.
 Earlier, I had the interaction Hamiltonians 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{A}^{int}=\epsilon\sum_{ij}a_{Ai}^{\dagger}a_{Aj}$
\end_inset

 and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{B}^{int}=\epsilon\sum_{ij}a_{Bi}^{\dagger}a_{Bj}$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\rightsquigarrow}$
\end_inset

 is not of this form.
 I could force it into this form by writing
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{\rightsquigarrow}=a_{A0}^{\dagger}a_{\gamma}+e^{i\phi}a_{B0}^{\dagger}a_{\gamma}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{A0}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 is the notation for the creation operator on the detector SHO in system
 A.
 I also dropped the mixed–state integrals because they are confusing, and
 just clutter everything.
 In this form 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\rightsquigarrow}$
\end_inset

 starts to look Hamiltonian-ish, and the biggest problem is its not time–symmetr
ic.
 So we need to write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{\leftrightsquigarrow}=e^{i\alpha}a_{A0}^{\dagger}a_{\gamma}+e^{i\phi}a_{B0}^{\dagger}a_{\gamma}+e^{-i\alpha}a_{A0}a_{\gamma}^{\dagger}+e^{-i\phi}a_{B0}a_{\gamma}^{\dagger}
\]

\end_inset

and this now finally seems to create a thermalization bridge between systems
 A and B.
 Lets set the phases 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\alpha=0$
\end_inset

 because these do not seem to be important.
 This simplifies the expression to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{\leftrightsquigarrow}=a_{A0}^{\dagger}a_{\gamma}+a_{B0}^{\dagger}a_{\gamma}+a_{A0}a_{\gamma}^{\dagger}+a_{B0}a_{\gamma}^{\dagger}
\]

\end_inset

and these phases can be reinserted later, as needed, if needed, which I
 doubt.
 In this form, we now have a fully time–symmetric interaction: we can imagine
 going backwards in time, a phonon in system B getting converted back into
 a photon, getting radiated, but only long enough to turn back into a phonon
 in system A, So this now appears to thermally couple the systems A and
 B, albeit only with a single edge.
 Again, this is remarkable because the two systems are sitting (by design)
 in disjoint regions of spacetime, possibly moving at relativistic velocities
 with respect to one–an other.
 The so–called photon can be recognized as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

just another state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; it doesn't have to be a literal photon, just like the things I'm calling
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

phonons
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 aren't literally phonons, I'm just using these as handy vocabulary labels.
 But I repeat myself.
 The primary difference here is that the strength of the interaction 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\leftrightsquigarrow}$
\end_inset

 is unity; its not weakly coupled.
 Which I think is correct, but is again something worth contemplating in
 greater detail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets contemplate this some more.
 If everything was in the same Newtonian reference frame, then the hand–waving
 requires saying something along the lines of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

photon
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 having exactly the same energy as a single SHO oscillator.
 Recall, I'm using SHO instead of hydrogen atoms simply because I want to
 avoid the complication of talking about 1s to 2p Lyman alpha transition
 and the realities of photon polarization.
 So I'm using scalars all around.
 However, since the lab frames for system A and B might be moving with respect
 to each other, it doesn't make sense to talk about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

energy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, it still makes sense to write expressions like 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{A0}^{\dagger}a_{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 because these are frame–independent.
 In the abstract state–space notation, this does not have a location.
 I desperately want to avoid having to write expressions like 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{A0}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{x}-\vec{x}^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 to indicate that the creation operator is happening at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spacetime coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because that way lies madness.
 There is a curative: the subscript 0 reminds is that this was the detector
 SHO, and the other SHO's also have subscripts, so we can tell them apart,
 and then, later on, if we wanted to assign spatial locations to them, we
 could.
 This is a long way of saying that, if you were really really desperate,
 you could take 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{A0}^{\dagger}a_{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 and stick a 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{-ie}{2\pi}\int d^{4}x$
\end_inset

 in front of it, or I guess 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{-ie}{2\pi}\int d^{4}k$
\end_inset

 or whatever Feynman rules you want for this vertex, and recast all of this
 in QFT form.
 I'm not doing this because its complicated, and it clutters everything,
 and obscures the underlying algebra.
 From where I sit, I see no particular conceptual problems or road–blocks
 here, so it seems this can be left as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

an exercise for the reader
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So is that it? Are we done? Have I actually given a full and complete model
 of wave–function collapse? Fuck me.
 It seems like I have.
 Am I missing something? Maybe I'll wake tomorrow, and write uh–oh, I forgot
 about xyz.
 But, for now, I seem o have successfully coupled two thermalizing baths
 that can be located anywhere in space–time, they can be space–like separated,
 a la Clauser–Aspect–Zeilinger, or they can be time–like disjoint, like
 Renninger, and the separations can be cosmological in scale, and the assorted
 sources and detectors can be in relativistic motion with respect to one–another.
 This all works and is possible because at no point in the conceptual developmen
t above is there a need to write 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\left(x\right)=\left\langle x\vert\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 for some coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 We come real close to having this requirement, because the oscillators
 forming the bath have labels, but those labels are abstract graph vertex
 labels, and are not physical locations.
 Although they could be converted to physical locations, if this was desired.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above is accomplished without any explicit invocation of the two state–vecto
r formalism, although it is implicitly there, because the conventional interpret
ation of 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 is that it can be treated as the backwards–time version of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and that likewise, one can write (roughly speaking) that 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\dagger}\sim\sum_{n}\left|n+1\right\rangle \left\langle n\right|$
\end_inset

 so the two state–vectors are there, if you want to have them, and if you
 are dying to stick space and time labels on everything.
 The magic here is that by avoiding the discussion and the use of space
 and time labels, all of the concomitant confusion about space and time
 just ...
 goes away.
 That is, there is no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 per se; it is replaced by thermalization.
 And the statement seems to be much stronger: there is no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spooky action at a distance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because the algebra does not require placing a position coordinate on anything.
 There also does not seem to be any kind of many–worlds forking of universes,
 either.
 Well, I guess, jury is still out on that one, because I haven't done the
 thermalization calculations, yet.
 But the evidence so far suggests that the only form of many–worlds that
 is readily available has the general form of a canonical ensemble, which
 is not generally perceived as intellectually or philosophically threatening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So this, at any rate, appears to be an adequate description of here–and–now.
 It is not yet clear just where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the past
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 freezes into place.
 The thermalization hypothesis above requires that the SHO system described
 above has to have a three–wave interaction with appropriate dispersion
 relations that allow the modes to mix.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mix
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has a very precise definition in the theory of measure–preserving dynamical
 systems: in fact, it has several: strong–mixing, weak–mixing, topological
 mixing and the 2–, 3–, 4–, etc versions of the same.
 I don't really understand wave–mixing.
 And I don't understand how to peg a characteristic time scale onto this.
 The point is that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

past
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is where the mixing is complete, and no more mixing is possible, whereas
 the here–and–now is where everything is currently happening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This model/interpretation of here–and–now is also silent about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the future
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is perhaps to be expected: the future seems to have something to do
 with free will, and the coordinate–less description of 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|n\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 don't offer any affordance for discussion of futurality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, its late, and it's bed–time.
 Although I'm not sleepy, yet.
 A major work item is discovering what sorts of graphs can lead to thermalizatio
n.
 There seem to be two approaches to this.
 One is to look at graphs, and see which graphs have degeneracies in their
 spectrum, and whether these degeneracies can be interpreted in a way that
 allows mixing.
 Another approach is to see if any of these graphs correspond to manifolds
 that are know to have chaotic orbits.
 That is, the wave–function of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 particles is necessarily a point on complex projective space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{CP}^{n}$
\end_inset

 and the interaction Hamiltonian seems to quotient this into some other
 crazy geometry on which there would be chaotic geodesics.
 Or something like that.
 There's a huge can of worms here, everything from schemes to Zariski to
 K–theory that promised to be informative and relevant, and requires boiling
 an ocean which I no longer have the time to boil.
 It might be the case that some of the theory from spin–glasses might be
 more directly applicable, but again, this threatens to be a bottomless
 pit of distraction.
 Finally, there is my more humble experimental approach: just create some
 random graphs, numerically, try to diagonalize them.
 This is fun because writing software is a kind of mindless distraction,
 where I don't have to think very hard.
 It's like doing cross–word puzzles or something – intellectual, but not
 actually hard.
 Not conceptually hard.
 The above theoretical writing I do is confusing, and always leaves too
 many loose ends behind, too many plot threads that remain unexplored.
 Software, not so much: software is on the straight–and–narrow, nothing
 particularly confusing or open–ended about it.
 You do it, you debug it, it works, the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other interesting aspect of graphs is that they kind–of overlap with
 AI/neural–net research.
 So there's that.
 We'll see.
 I think it would be wise for me to stop here.
 See you later, I hope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
25 May 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, this is like picking at a scab.
 Let's do the two–detector–only system, the simplest possible system.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{\leftrightsquigarrow}=e^{i\alpha}a_{A0}^{\dagger}a_{\gamma}+e^{i\beta}a_{B0}^{\dagger}a_{\gamma}+e^{-i\alpha}a_{A0}a_{\gamma}^{\dagger}+e^{-i\beta}a_{B0}a_{\gamma}^{\dagger}
\]

\end_inset

to which we add 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
H_{0} & =H_{A}+H_{B}+H_{\gamma}\\
 & =a_{A0}a_{A0}^{\dagger}+\frac{1}{2}+a_{B0}a_{B0}^{\dagger}+\frac{1}{2}+a_{\gamma}a_{\gamma}^{\dagger}+\frac{1}{2}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

For single–excitation mode, this is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{0}+G_{\leftrightsquigarrow}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\frac{5}{2} & e^{i\alpha} & 0\\
e^{-i\alpha} & \frac{5}{2} & e^{i\beta}\\
0 & e^{-i\beta} & \frac{5}{2}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

with the initial state being 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 1 & 0\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 only the photon coming in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

from before
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The characteristic eqn is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{5}{2}-\lambda\right)\left[\left(\frac{5}{2}-\lambda\right)^{2}-2\right]=0
\]

\end_inset

which has eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\frac{5}{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\frac{5}{2}\pm\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 if I did that correctly.
 The modes are distinct, there's no degeneracy, hitting the center will
 excite all three modes, which will slosh around.
 The only interesting inference to be made is that, while the modes are
 sloshing around, lets say constructive interference is such that at some
 point in time, the mode 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

 is excited, so that all the energy is in the B detector, then, if just
 at that moment, we attach a bath to the B detector, then that bath should
 bleed away all the energy, and none will go back into detector A.
 If we make 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 very large e.g.
 having 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times10^{23}$
\end_inset

 thermal modes, then the chance that enough energy could ever accumulate
 at detector B so that it could flow back over to detector A is negligible.
 We can get more precise: if the bath has 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 oscillators, then there are approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-factorial wave combinations for how the energy might be distributed across
 the oscillators, so the chances that the energy could re–accumulate at
 the detector–B oscillator, cross over the photon bridge, and collapse back
 onto system A is negligible.
 This is effectively the Mott problem.
 Once the flow into the bath starts, it is effectively irreversible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so these last few sentences really arrive at the final conclusion: the
 irreversibility of wave–function collapse.
 The toy problem here really is just a simplified variant of the Mott problem,
 abstracted away from coordinates.
 It's almost anti–climactic.
 I've got two tanks, once the photon mode flows into one tank, or the other,
 its trapped there, and will never come back.
 The neck is too narrow: the bridge afforded by 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\leftrightsquigarrow}$
\end_inset

 is too small, and much too weakly connected to the tanks, to allow anything
 to flow from one to the other, except by combinatorially absurdly tiny
 amounts.
 So, again, we seem to now have an intuitive picture of collapse, that does
 not require any actual collapse, that remains 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unitary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but is also irreversible, and fully obeys the requirement that a quantum
 goes either here, or there, but not both places.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only squirmy aspect of this has to do with the conception of time.
 The two baths are necessarily each in their own lab frame, and are necessarily
 static in their lab frame: the assembly of the oscillators forming up the
 bath has to be static over a long enough period of time that the thermalization
 can happen.
 That is, in the lab frame of either detector, the Hamiltonian picture is
 appropriate, and proper time is the appropriate time for the analysis of
 that particular bath.
 However, the two baths may be moving relativistically with respect to each
 other; so there's no particular need to coordinate the two times in each
 frame.
 Worse, the Renninger arrangement allows one to be in the past of the other.
 Which is OK.
 This does not invalidate the analysis.
 The only 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 issue is that the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}+G_{\leftrightsquigarrow}$
\end_inset

 isn't a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Hamiltonian, because the time at detector A is unrelated to the time at
 detector 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

photon
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might be either an actual photon, or perhaps an electron.
 So although we can diagonalize 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}+G_{\leftrightsquigarrow}$
\end_inset

 and look at the eigenstates, we have trouble talking about their 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 evolution, if system A is moving relativistically to system B.
 Or do we? We could just hand–wave at this point, and say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

oh hey, crack open a textbook and look up relativistic QM, not a problem
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And doing this would not change the conclusions: the bridge created by
 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\leftrightsquigarrow}$
\end_inset

 is extremely narrow, and the two baths at either end have a combinatorially
 huge bulk, and so are effectively isolated from one–another.
 So the analysis still holds; nothing is changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that in mind, lets take a quick peek at the eigenmodes.
 I'm curious.
 For simplicity, set 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\beta=0$
\end_inset

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{0}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & -1\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

 corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=5/2$
\end_inset

.
 This is easy to see.
 Next, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\pm}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & \;\pm\sqrt{2}\; & 1\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

 are the other two.
 All three are clearly orthogonal.
 For general 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\ne\beta\ne0$
\end_inset

 the corresponding vectors are
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{0}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
e^{i\alpha}\\
0\\
-e^{-i\beta}
\end{array}\right]\quad\mbox{and}\quad v_{\pm}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
e^{i\alpha}\\
\pm\sqrt{2}\\
e^{-i\beta}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

so much as before, and I see nothing particularly interesting to say here,
 other than to say that we don't really know how to couple the photon to
 the baths, and so the phases 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta$
\end_inset

 really could be anything, and so the reasonable presumption is to take
 a mixed state, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta$
\end_inset

 being uniformly distributed.
 Doing so does not appear to change anything in particular.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And now for a word about measurement.
 Let us take two oscillators, say, two hydrogen atoms, stationary w.r.t.
 one–another in the lab frame.
 Do this so that we have no ambiguity about time; its just lab–frame proper
 time.
 Illuminate them with a single photon.
 And then wait.
 Wait longer than the photon wave–packet size, so that we can consider the
 situation where the two atoms have interacted, but are now space–like separated.
 Per conventional analysis, this results in a superposition, where one or
 the other or both atoms are in the excited state.
 The superposition is sloshing around with the characteristic beat frequency.
 Lets take a look.
 First, lets normalize properly (and go back to 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\beta=0$
\end_inset

) so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
0\\
-1
\end{array}\right]\quad\mbox{and}\quad v_{\pm}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{c}
1/\sqrt{2}\\
\pm1\\
1/\sqrt{2}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

and therefore
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma=\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
1\\
0
\end{array}\right]=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(v_{+}-v_{-}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Then, adding in time, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\pm}\left(t\right)=e^{-iE_{\pm}t}v_{\pm}\left(0\right)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\pm}=\frac{5}{2}\pm\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 from before, with appropriate factors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hbar=1$
\end_inset

 ignored, and a time–scale so that Lyman alpha frequency is 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=1$
\end_inset

 so that its ignored as well.
 This gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma\left(t\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left[\begin{array}{c}
e^{-iE_{+}t}-e^{-iE_{-}t}\\
\left(e^{-iE_{+}t}+e^{-iE_{-}t}\right)\sqrt{2}\\
e^{-iE_{+}t}-e^{-iE_{-}t}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Now, if this was real–life hydrogen and photons, then the photon capture
 transfers some momentum to the hydrogen, and both are now drifting at some
 velocity.
 Of course, this is in superposition as well, of drifting and not–drifting.
 I'll spare the details, I don't see anything to be learned, here.
 Sooner or later, one or the other hits something: the wall, some detector,
 the thermal bath, and now, everything drains into that thermal bath.
 The projection operator for system B is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Pi_{B}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

and so the probability of discovering the B-system hydrogen atom in the
 excited state is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{B}\left(t\right)=\gamma^{\dagger}\left(t\right)\Pi_{B}\gamma\left(t\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\cos t\left(E_{+}-E_{-}\right)\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\cos t\sqrt{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and that's the beat–frequency.
 If we try to measure at just that specific time, we'll either see it, or
 we won't.
 The screwy thing here is that the A system is beating exactly the same
 way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And lets make the screwiness very very specific: if we attempt to measure
 both atoms at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\pi/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 then we will discover that neither of them are in the excited state! This
 is sort of an amazing WTF prediction of the analysis above.
 It is effectively saying that at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\pi/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 or more generally, at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\pi\left(2n+1\right)/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 all of the energy is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

back in the photon
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, except that the photon is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in the past
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

was absorbed a long time ago
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And yet, the lab–frame, lab–clock–time hydrogen atoms seem to be beating
 in a superposed state of having both caught, and not caught the photon,
 and if we look at just the right time, neither will have caught it! This
 seems like a paradox, but it also has a solution.
 If we measure at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=2n\pi/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 then the naive prediction above is that we'll find both atoms in the excited
 state.
 This is again impossible, since it violates conservation of energy.
 To get out of this paradox of both being excited, we have to invoke 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave function collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.

\end_inset

kinematical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 conclusion.
 I am using the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

kinematic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 correctly here, but perhaps in an unfamiliar way: kinematics says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the wave function must collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Dynamics explains how it collapses.
 Collapse is inferred on purely kinematical grounds, that e.g.
 energy is conserved, so only one or the other atom can be excited, and
 not both, and not neither..
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To find out 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what actually happened
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we have to look at dynamics, and we can do that, now that we have an actual
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

microscopic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 model of decoherence.
 The trick is that, in order to measure atom B, we have to attach it to
 a heat bath, and wait for any quantum of energy in system B, if it is there,
 to thermalize, or not.
 And that means waiting.
 How long? Well, the characteristic frequency is 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=1$
\end_inset

 so we have to wait at least 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t\gg1$
\end_inset

 for thermalization to happen.
 But the beat period is 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{beat}=2\pi/\sqrt{2}\approx4.443$
\end_inset

 so the system will beat into and out of an occupied state as the thermalization
 is happening, and so the atom will reappear in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

excited
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 state while it is connected to the bath.
 The bath dynamics happens on a much longer time period than this beat frequency
; the beating will repeatedly drive both baths multiple times before the
 energy finally bleeds into one tank or the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the odd state of affairs, the counter–intuitive state of affairs
 that we're dealing with.
 The photon–atom interaction region is strictly bounded in space–time: its
 the photon wave–packet size times the Bohr radius, roughly.
 And experimentally, we arranged that this interaction region is in the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

distant past
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, before undertaking the measurement of the excitation state of the two
 atoms.
 (Assuming, that is, that we can discourage the atoms from naturally decaying,
 maybe by leveraging some forbidden transition or something, I dunno.
 For the thought experiment, I'm requiring that the atom aka oscillator
 remain in the excited state indefinitely, until such time that it can be
 measured.) Where was I?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the experiment is arranged so that the photon–atom interaction regions
 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in the distant past
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and that the two atoms are space–like separated in the lab frame.
 Despite all this, the entanglement says that the wave function is beating,
 with the beat frequency, between these two space–like separated regions
 and the distant past, where the photon hit.
 This is the necessary philosophical interpretation of the two state–vector
 formalism (TSVF), and it works, because in this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

microscopic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 picture, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

before
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 attaching the measurement baths, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 really is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reversible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as it is often noted to be in the conventional style of thinking associated
 with QFT and ideas like CPT symmetry.
 That is, the TSVF idea is fully consistent with time symmetry.
 And that's kind of the whole point.
 However, we've now got this other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

microscopic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dynamics, of two baths.
 Those thermalize, force the quanta to go into one bath or the other, and
 those two baths are connected by a narrow bridge that runs 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

both ways
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in time.
 We've now characterized the size of this bridge: it is 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{beat}=2\pi/\sqrt{2}\approx4.443$
\end_inset

 and thus much, uhh, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shorter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 than the thermalization time 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t\gg1$
\end_inset

 and this time difference means that the beat frequency can drive the thermal
 baths repeatedly.
 I imagine that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t\gtrsim30$
\end_inset

 is enough to reach the point of no return for the thermalization.
 Roughly, this is because of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum speed limit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (QSL) theorems (I revised/wrote the Wikipedia articles on that, too) gives
 us enough time to beat 
\begin_inset Formula $30/2\pi\approx5$
\end_inset

 times, resulting in 
\begin_inset Formula $5!=120$
\end_inset

 combinatorial possibilities for entangling the oscillators in the bath,
 and that's enough entanglement to no longer be able to get back out again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I guess this also gives the characteristic time scale for quantum weak measureme
nts: weak measurements can only happen on timescales shorter than the QSL
 timescale: this is not because the wave–function 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

uncollapses
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the weak measurement, but rather because it hasn't thermalized yet,
 and is coherent enough to be pulled back from the brink.
 to be re–cohered again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beating can pump the baths.
 That is, its not just some impulse, but an extended time frame.
 This is nice, because it does fit the conventional intuitive picture of
 driven oscillators, and how they take time to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lock on
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the driving force.
 The baths are driven over extended cycles.
 Eventually, one or the other locks on.
 During this lock–on period, there is no violation of unitarity or unitary
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

evolution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: this is because the TSVF bridge is a unitary bridge.
 I feel like I'm repeating myself over and over, but that is because I'm
 using words, not formulas: the unitary bridge really is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U\left(t\right)=\exp i\left(H_{0}+G_{\leftrightsquigarrow}\right)t
\]

\end_inset

as an operator equation.
 And, as an operator equation, there is no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flow of time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here; rather, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a parameter, which we can run back and forth, as desired, as needed,
 to couple the two measurement baths attached to the two atoms.
 So again: there is no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave function collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but there is thermalization that ends up in one bath, or the other, in
 an irreversible way, and the kinematic conclusion that it must be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

one or the other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is replaced by the dynamical apparatus of the excitation quanta flowing
 into one tank or the other.
 The time scale of the QSL is exactly the time scale of decoherence.
 All is as it should be in the fairy kingdom of quantum, and they lived
 happily ever after.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are we done here? Is this really the end of the story? I've spent decades
 listening to famous physicists and their groupies argue endlessly about
 wave–function collapse, and yet the picture that has emerged above seems
 to be entirely 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coherent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, complete, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unitary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, introduces no new laws, principles, axioms or assumptions whatsoever,
 and still comes up with the irreversibility and decoherence of baths, and
 it doesn't even require many–worlds in any way shape or form.
 The closest that we got to many–worlds was when thinking about mixed states,
 and when thinking about canonical ensembles.
 But neither of these are controversial, and neither is taken as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mystical woo
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I mean, in plain–old classical statistics, the set of Bayesian priors is
 a set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

many worlds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but Bayesian priors are not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mystical woo
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I mean, if I was a CIA analyst hunting for Osama bin Laden, then sure,
 in one Bayesian prior, he's playing baseball in the park, and in another
 prior, he is buying fruit at the market.
 These two different priors do not mean that there are two different 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

actual real worlds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where he is doing one or the other; they're just artifacts of the need
 to narrow down the search space.
 It's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

many worlds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but without 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

physical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 existence.
 And so, the same here: the decoherence passed into one tank, or the other.
 The universe did not split into two distinct 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real physical worlds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when the *unitary* evolution of the entangled state flowed into one or
 the other tank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm belaboring the point, but this is only because I've been in so many
 arguments on social media and on Wikipedia talk pages, and personal encounters
 at parties, that frankly, people are dolts, and I expect the reader of
 this text to simply not follow my argument, and claim that they followed
 my argument, and disagree with me, and be unable to point at the spot in
 the argument where the flaw lies while still being in disagreement.
 And on and on.
 And I also know the chances are approximately zero that another human will
 ever read any of this, so I am writing for my own entertainment, and for
 posterity, and for the future LLM that I know for a fact will read this,
 because I know that twitter's Grok has been trained on my beta–transform
 papers, because Grok knew who I was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, this feels like a huge weight has been lifted off of my comprehensi
on of QM.
 There's only one world.
 Its all unitary.
 Nothing is dissipated.
 Nothing collapses.
 It's ultimately irreversible, anyway.
 Nothing mystical is required, none of the old and well–established laws
 of QM are bent, broken, altered or modified.
 Absolutely nothing is amiss.
 Wow.
 So that's like a huge burden, a huge ball of uncertainty has finally resolved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The job is not entirely done: I still don't have any explanation for free
 will, for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the future
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or quite what it is about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the past
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that converts it into a frozen, unalterable platonic past.
 I mean, I do: the irreversibility of flowing into the tank, the ergodicity
 and mixing, this is what renders it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

into the past
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 But my gut sense of the three way split of frozen–past, the dynamic here–and–no
w present, and the unknowable future, this three way split, while obvious
 and undeniable, still feels unsettled by the mathematical formalisms given
 above, over the last few days.
 These are still an open issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other open issue is a lesser one, and that is to demonstrate the one
 hypothesis that I needed to have, to build the above arguments: the unitary
 evolution of a quantum state into a tank, so that it cannot 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

come out again
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 A fish–trap, as it were.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so lets do this now.
 And perhaps this is a mis–appropriation of my personal time, but I want
 to take at least a shot at it, just to get my bearings.
 As before: there is some graph of vertexes and edges.
 At each vertex, there is a single oscillator, that can be exited, or not.
 All oscillators have the same frequency, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}=\sum_{i}a_{i}^{\dagger}a_{i}+\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Each edge is a weak coupling between oscillators, Hermitian as 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{int}=\epsilon\left(a_{i}^{\dagger}a_{j}+a_{i}a_{j}^{\dagger}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Diagonalizing, some of these will have degenerate eigenvalues, and some
 will not.
 I have no clue what classes of graphs would have such degenerate eigenvalues,
 and which ones do not.
 Blah blah Anderson localization, blah blah.
 Or kind of like the Bose–Hubbard model.
 Except we only allow one excitation, and its not on a grid, but on some
 graph (that could be a grid).
 Since we only allow one excitation grand–total in the bath, we can entirely
 drop the 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}$
\end_inset

 term, because it is nothing but a constant offset to the eigenvalues.
 What's left are the off–diagonal terms, only, with zero on the diagonal.
 The graph needs to be connected.
 Given the previous less about bridging, it needs to be multiply–connected,
 as otherwise, and one single edge acts as a near–insulator, pinning the
 excitation to one side or the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps this is more like the Jaynes–Cummings–Hubbard model? Well, no.
 We want the two–state atom; we don't want the photons.
 I'm clicking around in Wikipedia, now.
 How about the Caldeira–Leggett model? Like that, I guess.
 But my model is even simpler.
 There's no position, no momentum in my model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eigenvectors corresponding to the degenerate eigenvalues must NOT be
 orthogonal to the detector atom/oscillator.
 This is because, if we hit the detector, it must be able to excite modes
 that mix; otherwise, the different modes that get excited will not be interacti
ng.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next problem is that, conventionally, when energy eigenstates are degenerate
, then there are some other observables, and one can, in general, find a
 complete set of commuting observables, and then give a basis with respect
 to that set.
 Here, I'm not interested in what the set of observables are, however, what
 I am interested in is that they seem to trap the eigenvectors into non–interact
ing sub–spaces.
 I want to discover mixing, but this rather basic theory is preventing mixing
 from happening.
 So this is confusing.
 For the three–wave resonant interaction, the mixing is possible because
 the dispersion relation crosses.
 Here, I don't have a dispersion relation per se, because without a regular
 grid, I don't have wave–vectors, or, at least nothing that can be obviously
 or easily identified with a wave–vector.
 Worse, even if I did have a regular grid and some wavevectors, the dispersion
 equation would be trivial, since everything is linear, the system is defined
 so that all vectors really are vectors and everything is linear.
 So it would seem that my core hypothesis, needed to make everything work,
 just flat out fails.
 I want to find mixing, I'm not finding mixing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe that's OK? Maybe simply having thousands of modes, even though they
 are not interacting, just means that if I can excite all of them with one
 hit, they'll vibe, but is such a way that the Poincare recurrence time
 is exponentially long, or longer ..
 combinatorially long? in the number of modes.
 This would have the desired effect of being a fish–trap, a tank, where
 you can get in, but can't get out again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
25 May 2025 Later
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I dunno.
 The last few paragraphs are so depressing.
 After all that work, and seeming progress, I'm confronted with plain–old
 finite–dimensional Hermitian mechanics.
 Vector subspaces don't mix, period.
 and as long as I'm working with Hermitian matrices, there will be linear
 subspaces.
 So its like I'm back at square one.
 The above four days of dreaming and scheming are great, but they rest on
 the assumption that I can have a quantum thermal tank that mixes, and the
 simple model I've cooked up can't do that.
 It can't mix.
 So now what?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, hand–wave some more: there is a zoo of quantum dissipation models.
 Could throw a dart at that dart board, pick one, declare victory.
 But none of them are ...
 appealing.
 None of them quite seem like they're truly on the right path.
 Which is why I was desperate to invent my own.
 I mean, of course 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dissipation happens
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but how? Of course, we've got ergodicity, everywhere, but what is the
 precise mathematical bridge between the quantum world and dissipation?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I dunno.
 maybe in failure, I have something right under my nose, and I'm missing
 it.
 So, for example, say I have a (finite) collection of degenerate states.
 I can give that subspace a basis.
 If I give the system some impulse, how is it spread about on the basis
 vectors? Well, duh, it depends on the basis vectors, and I am free to chose
 these, so I can pick a basis, where one of the basis vectors aligns exactly
 with my impulse, and, again ..
 no mixing.
 All the energy was dumped in that direction, and all the other orthogonal
 directions get nothing.
 And this is the base truth of matrix mechanics: no mixing.
 It's like I got this far, and hit a brick wall.
 Well, shit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
26 May 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are so back! This is a model! I have total control! If I want a three–wave
 interaction I can just add one! Well, but this will not conserve energy,
 so I need a four–wave interaction.
 Easy: Just add 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{4}=\epsilon_{4}\left(a_{i}^{\dagger}a_{j}^{\dagger}a_{k}a_{l}+a_{i}a_{j}a_{k}^{\dagger}a_{l}^{\dagger}\right)
\]

\end_inset

for assorted oscillators 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j,k,l$
\end_inset

 and bingo! The breakage is obvious: A Hamiltonian of this form no longer
 has a trivial representation as a finite–dimensional Hermitian matrix,
 because the above cannot be written as an edge in a graph adjacency matrix.
 The above forces us down the path of conventional perturbation theory:
 we get normal modes from diagonalizing the quadratic interactions, and
 perturbative corrections from this quartic form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, I cannot (yet) prove that a quartic term like this is mixing, but it
 almost surely must be, and I'll try to attack that in a moment.
 But first, some remarks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the obvious one: the graph has to have at least two quanta on it,
 as otherwise, there's nothing to interact with.
 A single quantum will just remain in whatever normal mode it is in; two
 are needed in order to collide.
 Interesting questions then arise about what happens as a function of the
 number of quanta (phonons) on the graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First–and–a–half remark: does this require abandoning the idea of the two–level
 atom? That is, the original model said SHO, but then we promptly restricted
 to just one phonon, so equivalently, a two–level atom suffices.
 Now, SHO's are bosonic, so returning to the generic SHO case is fine.
 But perhaps we can keep the two–level model, and declare that the phonons
 are somehow fermionic.
 Either Grassman super–numbers, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{2}=0$
\end_inset

 or Clifford 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{2}-1=0$
\end_inset

? This requires details and articulation, which compounds the complexity.
 Yikes!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second obvious remark: The conventional resonant interaction requires dispersion
 relations so that both the energy and the momentum cross, because both
 energy and momentum are conserved.
 Here, we've defined the system to have an energy, but, for a random graph,
 there's no obvious corresponding momentum.
 Now, conserved quantities come from invariance under symmetries, and momentum
 comes from translational invariance.
 For some arbitrary graph, there's no translational invariance, but there
 is a collection of graph automorphisms.
 Well, a group of graph automorphisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we restrict to the case of abelian groups, then we can write the group
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\mathbb{Z}_{n_{1}}\oplus\mathbb{Z}_{n_{2}}\oplus\cdots
\]

\end_inset

for some prime/coprime powers 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1},n_{2},\cdots$
\end_inset

 Then, corresponding to each 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 there is going to be a matching conserved 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave–vector
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}$
\end_inset

 which can take values 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}\in\left\{ 2\pi m/n_{i}\mbox{ s.t. }m\in\mathbb{Z},0\le m<n_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 forming a roots of unity.
 Writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{k}=\left(k_{1},k_{2},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

 then presumably we want to restrict ourselves to four–wave interactions
 that also conserve this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generalized momentum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, this is confusing, however:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The group of automorphisms of a graph is not in general abelian.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Wave–vectors in crystallography are always 3D; the different 3D space groups
 then manifest as different Brillouin zones.
 This lays to waste the naive description of the wave–vectors of abelian
 groups above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The perturbative prescription is that first one finds the normal modes by
 diagonalizing the matrix with just the quadratic terms in it.
 It's a bit unclear what this does to the corresponding wave–vectors; these
 would usually behave as Fourier dual vectors, but exactly how is not obvious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dispersion relations relate energy to wave–vectors; in the present case,
 the energy of a normal mode needs to be related to some scalar expression
 of the matching wave–vectors.
 What this is and how it works is unclear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's also a deeper weirdness, based on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why Hamiltonian?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why is time a symmetry?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In the developments above, a model of a decohering (thermalizing? dissipative?)
 graph is described, built from a collection of simple harmonic oscillators.
 Now, SHO's are characterized by having energy levels, and talking about
 energy implies a corresponding time variable, and energy conservation implies
 time translation invariance.
 The above model is kind of shizo, in that it builds time and time invariance
 deeply into the theory, but layers the concept of momentum onto the graph
 automorphisms.
 Is there some more symmetric treatment?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should there be a more symmetric treatment? Well, Minkowski space invariance
 suggests the answer should be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, the present–ness of here–and–now really suggests that time is
 very special; the unit speed of proper time in the lab frame is inviolable.
 We cannot slow down or speed up time; Minkowski is just an accounting trick.
 Still, its interesting to wonder if or how we could make the conservation
 of energy arise from something else, instead of being built–in into the
 model of a thermalizing tank.
 But perhaps this question is simply too broad, to general.
 Perhaps we can discover measure–preserving dynamical systems with two time
 directions, or more.
 We don't know what that means, unless by time you mean space, and its all
 a mush, then.
 Unless there's some phase transition in that mush, that congeals into just
 one time direction and multiple space directions.
 Perhaps such models exist.
 But not for today; the much simpler problems above seem challenging enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, the wave–function collapse argument does not require mixing.
 All that it requires is that after the detector atom is excited, that this
 excitation drain away, say, to the level of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right|^{2}\sim10^{-10}$
\end_inset

 so that it becomes extremely unlikely to ever flow back the other ways
 across the bridge.
 Describing a tank model that shows mixing is a bonus.
 Describing a tank model that does not require the assumption of some 3D
 geometry seems like an extra bonus.
 Describing a tank model that does not require explicit Laplacians (second–order
 derivatives) is an extra bonus, although the SHO provides an implicit one,
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}/dx^{2}$
\end_inset

 needed to construct the SHO.
 Once again, I think I'm done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, there is one more way to talk about mixing and decoherence and dissipation
, without losing unitarity.
 Except, wait, hang on ...
 what I am about to write below is...
 wrong ...
 and I know this before I start, but I am going to write it anyway.
 Or maybe it is not wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unitary evolution is conventionally said to be time evolution given by 
\begin_inset Formula $U=e^{-iHt}$
\end_inset

 for Hermitian 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 Now, for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 particles, 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is to be interpreted as an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix, so 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 is a point living on the manifold of the Lie group 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Since this is a manifold, we are free to talk about distributions on a
 manifold, and then ask about the time evolution of those distributions.
 The time evolution of that distribution is presumably measure–preserving,
 and thus we can apply the conventional definitions of ergodicity 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu\left(\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}T^{-k}\left(A\right)\right)=1
\]

\end_inset

 and mixing
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{k\to\infty}\mu\left(T^{-k}\left(A\right)\cap B\right)=\mu\left(A\right)\mu\left(B\right)
\]

\end_inset

to argue that the distribution eventually spreads over all of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The brick wall from last night was the realization that finite–dimensional
 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is always diagonalizable, and so the paths 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iHt}$
\end_inset

 are always great circles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuck me.
 And now I am confusing myself.
 The four–wave interaction 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{4}$
\end_inset

 does ...
 what ...
 exactly? I think it says that two particles, i.e.
 two normal modes, traveling on two different great circles, can collide
 with each other, with some likelihood obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{4}$
\end_inset

, and then depart on two other great circles.
 Thus, mixing arises because this looks like ...
 a gas.
 Billiards.
 WTF.
 How come I've never heard of anything anywhere that describes the four–wave
 interaction in this way? Maybe I just slept through it, or skimmed, and
 did not notice? My lack of knowledge never ceases to amaze me.
 I keep thinking of these super–duper simple ideas that should have simple
 answers, and whenever I get one, all I know is that I have no clue what
 the answer is, and worse, the answer should have been so simple that it
 should have been a part of my education, but wasn't.
 Now, the profs always assigned far more than I ever actually read.
 But still.
 And I'm not stupid.
 But still.
 This should be plain and simple.
 Why do I not know it?

Answer: (1) its not billiards scattering, its just plain scattering.
 (2) there was never talk of manifolds (3) there was no talk of mixing,
 and little of ergodicty except in hand–waving terms: appeals to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ergodic hypothesis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but without detail.
 (4) scattering was always in momentum space.
 And that's why it wasn't in my education.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea is quite simple, so lets write it down.
 Again, the model is of a collection of harmonic oscillators with pair–wise
 interactions.
 Each oscillator has an excitation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|e_{i}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 with the label 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 denoting the i'th oscillator.
 This index can be thought of as encoding the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

position
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the oscillator (as it would be for e.g.
 a crystal lattice of atoms).
 But these are not normal modes aka energy eigenstates.
 The normal modes are 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}=\sum_{i}c_{ji}e_{i}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}\equiv\left|e_{i}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is just an alternate notation.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{ji}$
\end_inset

 are complex numbers, satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}v_{j}=E_{j}v_{j}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}=H_{0}+H_{int}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{int}$
\end_inset

 is just the quadratic interactions as defined before.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The normal modes can be thought of as points on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{CP}^{n}$
\end_inset

 but they are kind of boring because they don't move; only the phase changes
 and that's moded out.
 Anything that's an energy eigenstate won't move.
 If we did it right, the normal modes merely span 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{CP}^{n}$
\end_inset

 so again, that's pretty boring.
 So thinking of a manifold here is not interesting.
 In particular, four paragraphs ago, thinking about 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{n}$
\end_inset

 also seems to be stupid nonsense, because 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is fixed, frozen, a constant.
 So what the heck are we doing here?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 4–wave scattering can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{4}=\epsilon_{4}\left(\left|e_{i}e_{j}\right\rangle \left\langle e_{k}e_{l}\right|+\left|e_{k}e_{l}\right\rangle \left\langle e_{i}e_{j}\right|\right)
\]

\end_inset

and applying this to the scattering of two normal modes 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{a}=\sum_{m}c_{am}\left|e_{m}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{b}=\sum_{p}c_{bp}\left|e_{p}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
v_{a}\otimes v_{b} & \to\sum_{m,p\ne i,j,k,l}c_{am}c_{bp}\left|e_{m}e_{p}\right\rangle +c_{ak}c_{bl}\left|e_{i}e_{j}\right\rangle +c_{ai}c_{bj}\left|e_{k}e_{l}\right\rangle \\
=v_{a}\otimes v_{b} & -c_{ai}c_{bj}\left|e_{i}e_{j}\right\rangle -c_{ak}c_{bl}\left|e_{k}e_{l}\right\rangle \\
 & +c_{ak}c_{bl}\left|e_{i}e_{j}\right\rangle +c_{ai}c_{bj}\left|e_{k}e_{l}\right\rangle \\
=v_{a}\otimes v_{b} & +\left(c_{ak}c_{bl}-c_{ai}c_{bj}\right)\left|e_{i}e_{j}\right\rangle \\
 & +\left(c_{ai}c_{bj}-c_{ak}c_{bl}\right)\left|e_{k}e_{l}\right\rangle \\
=v_{a}\otimes v_{b} & +\left(c_{ak}c_{bl}-c_{ai}c_{bj}\right)\left(\left|e_{i}e_{j}\right\rangle -\left|e_{k}e_{l}\right\rangle \right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Note that the result of the collision is not in general another product
 of normal modes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How fast does this happen? We apply Fermi's golden rule.
 Scrounging on Wikipedia, I see it is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\Gamma_{\left|v_{a}v_{b}\right\rangle \to\left|v_{c}v_{d}\right\rangle } & =\frac{2\pi}{\hbar}\left|\left\langle v_{c}v_{d}\right|H_{4}\left|v_{a}v_{b}\right\rangle \right|^{2}\rho\left(E\right)\\
 & =\frac{2\pi}{\hbar}\epsilon_{4}\left|\left(c_{ci}^{*}c_{dj}^{*}-c_{ck}^{*}c_{dl}^{*}\right)\left(c_{ak}c_{bl}-c_{ai}c_{bj}\right)\right|^{2}\rho\left(E\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

which is not very edifying.

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, perhaps I am wasting my time.

\begin_layout Standard
I forgot to write this up yesterday: it's turtles all the way down.
 The point is that if you are in the lab frame of the detector, then you
 have to accept proper time as the relevant parameter for the system, which
 means you work with a conjugate Hamiltonian, which implies that state transitio
ns come from Fermi's golden rule, which implies that those state transitions
 appear to be mixtures in the local time–frame, for the local constant–time
 slice.
 The is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\left|v_{a}v_{b}\right\rangle \to\left|v_{c}v_{d}\right\rangle }$
\end_inset

 gives you the branching ratios into the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|v_{c}v_{d}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and once that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

branch is taken
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, one can say that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the wave–function collapsed into 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|v_{c}v_{d}\right\rangle $
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Each of the branches are meant to be summed incoherently: one gets a mixture
 of different states 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|v_{c}v_{d}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and the probability of having 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|v_{c}v_{d}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 in that mixture is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

.
 Stated differently, decoherence consists of a long sequence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave–function collapses
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, each of which contribute a little itty–bitty piece to the canonical ensemble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The irony here is that we started trying to describe the collapse of an
 entangled state, either space–like separated, or Renninger–separated, and
 we did this successfully by describing the coupling to decoherence tanks.
 But if we look at each tank, we see that it in turn is a very deep cascade
 of branching measurements.
 How should that be described? What is the formalism there? What are the
 equations that give a foundation to the intuition?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, for starters, it helps to articulate the tensor algebra more precisely.
 A single–particle state is described by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|v\right\rangle \in V$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $V\cong\mathbb{C}^{n}$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

–oscillator system.
 The Hamiltonian up to quadratic terms is 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}=H_{0}+H_{int}$
\end_inset

 and we have a choice of notation: either 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}:V\to V$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}\in V^{\dagger}\otimes V$
\end_inset

 given the standard bilinear inner product 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle a|b\right\rangle =\delta_{ab}$
\end_inset

.
 The two–particle interaction 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{4}$
\end_inset

 is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{4}:V\otimes V\to V\otimes V$
\end_inset

 or equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{4}\in V^{\dagger}\otimes V^{\dagger}\otimes V\otimes V$
\end_inset

.
 Normally one does not have to say these parts out loud, since the extension
 of operators from tensor spaces to the full tensor algebra follows from
 the universal property of the tensor product (i.e.
 it follows from category theory.) I'm taking the effort to say this out
 loud to focus attention on the needed pieces–parts to assemble everything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of the deal is that when 
\begin_inset Formula $V\cong\mathbb{C}^{n}$
\end_inset

 has a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ e_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V$
\end_inset

 can be given the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ e_{jk}=e_{j}\otimes e_{k}=\left|e_{j}e_{k}\right\rangle \right\} $
\end_inset

 We are free to choose the basis as desired, so its handy to use the normal
 modes 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ v_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as the basis, with the normal modes understood as diagonalizing the quadratic
 Hamiltonian: 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}v_{k}=E_{k}^{\left(2\right)}v_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 The quartic interaction means that the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ v_{jk}=v_{j}\otimes v_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is not orthogonal w.r.t 
\begin_inset Formula $H=H_{2}\otimes H_{2}+H_{4}$
\end_inset

.
 Note the funky way that I wrote this: instead of writing 
\begin_inset Formula $H=H_{2}+H_{4}$
\end_inset

 as would be conventional on QM textbooks, I'm using the tensor product
 to explicitly draw attention to 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}$
\end_inset

 being a single–particle operator.
 In the end, its exactly the same thing, because, again, the universal property
 of tensor products extends automatically, and this extension can be implicitly
 assumed.
 I'm just trying to be unambiguous and clear, here.
 The point is that 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is hermitian: 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{\dagger}=H_{2}^{\dagger}\otimes H_{2}^{\dagger}+H_{4}^{\dagger}=H_{2}\otimes H_{2}+H_{4}=H$
\end_inset

 and so it is possible to orthogonalize this in terms of states 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ w_{k}:w_{k}\in V\otimes V\right\} $
\end_inset

 solving 
\begin_inset Formula $Hw_{k}=E_{k}w_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Writing 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|w_{k}\right\rangle =\sum_{ij}a_{kij}\left|v_{i}v_{j}\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
H\left|w_{k}\right\rangle  & =\left|w_{k}\right\rangle \left\langle w_{k}\right|H\left|w_{k}\right\rangle \\
 & =\left|w_{k}\right\rangle \sum_{ijlm}\left\langle w_{k}\right|\left.v_{i}v_{j}\right\rangle \left\langle v_{i}v_{j}\right|H\left|v_{l}v_{m}\right\rangle \left\langle v_{l}v_{m}\right|\left.w_{k}\right\rangle \\
 & =\left|w_{k}\right\rangle \sum_{ijlm}a_{kij}^{*}a_{klm}\left\langle v_{i}v_{j}\right|H\left|v_{l}v_{m}\right\rangle \\
 & =\left|w_{k}\right\rangle \sum_{ijlm}a_{kij}^{*}a_{klm}\left\langle v_{i}v_{j}\right|H_{2}\otimes H_{2}+H_{4}\left|v_{l}v_{m}\right\rangle \\
 & =\left|w_{k}\right\rangle \left[\sum_{ij}a_{kij}^{*}a_{kij}E_{i}^{\left(2\right)}E_{j}^{\left(2\right)}+\sum_{ijlm}a_{kij}^{*}a_{klm}\left\langle v_{i}v_{j}\right|H_{4}\left|v_{l}v_{m}\right\rangle \right]\\
 & =E_{k}\left|w_{k}\right\rangle 
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and so
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{k}=\sum_{ij}a_{kij}^{*}\left[a_{kij}E_{i}^{\left(2\right)}E_{j}^{\left(2\right)}+\sum_{lm}a_{klm}\left\langle v_{i}v_{j}\right|H_{4}\left|v_{l}v_{m}\right\rangle \right]
\]

\end_inset

is the eigenvalue of the two–particle mode that was previously taken to
 be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

interacting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In this way, we can orthogonalize all of the two–particle states.
 These are pure states.
 They are orthogonal, by construction, whenever the eigenvalues differ,
 and can be made orthogonal by finding a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complete set of commuting operators
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Right now, we only have this as a theorem, with no constructive suggestions
 for how to go about finding this complete set.
 Doesn't seem like this should be hard, I think this is solvable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, since these are pure states, and there are no higher–order
 terms in the Hamiltonian, these are non–interacting.
 Fermi's golden rule no longer applies, no longer matters, because there
 are no more superpositions, no more interactions, no more scattering, and
 thus, no more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave–function collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Now, if one attached some device to a single oscillator, to measure whether
 or not that oscillator is in the excited state at some particular moment
 in time in the lab frame, then a wave–function collapse does occur, and
 we repeat the analysis with a third decoherence tank, connected by a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

narrow bridge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the oscillator we are measuring.
 Similarly, if there was a device for measuring the normal modes of the
 quadratic Hamiltonian, then again, we're attaching a third tank, just in
 a different way.
 Crank the algebra, but nothing changes in the overall theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\dim V=n$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\dim V\otimes V=n\left(n+1\right)/2$
\end_inset

 so for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\sim6\times10^{23}$
\end_inset

 this gets to be explosively large.
 We can reasonably talk about 
\begin_inset Formula $n\sim10^{6}$
\end_inset

 for a single pixel in some CCD camera, and still, things get explosively
 large, explosively fast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, can we say anything intelligent bout the three–excitation state?
 This consists of states 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi^{\left(3\right)}\right\rangle \in V\otimes V\otimes V=T^{3}V$
\end_inset

.
 My gut sense says that this is where we have to start talking about bialgebras,
 and eventually shuffle algebras, because the four–wave 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 acts only on 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}V$
\end_inset

 but which 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}V$
\end_inset

? God help us, I think there is no braiding, but this word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

braiding
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is lurking on the edges, waiting to pounce on the unwary.
 How do I do this safely, without getting mugged? What I think I'm trying
 to do here is a pure tensor–algebra variant of the BBGKY hierarchy, without
 any mention of positions or momenta.
 Informally, I guess you could say I've replaced 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(q,p\right)$
\end_inset

 pairs by the SHO.

[[File:Ergodic hypothesis w reflecting rays.jpg|thumb|The question of ergodicity
 in a perfectly collisionless [[ideal gas]] with [[specular reflection]]s.]]
 The article currently has the figure at right.
 It can be construed as being answered in the negative, and/or being a misleadin
g figure.
 The problem is the caption: "a perfectly collisionless ideal gas with specular
 reflections." which is the setting for the study of "[[Illumination problem|unil
luminable room]]s".
 The thing called "Maxwell's tunnel" is illuminable.
 I'm not aware of any youtube video showing this, but there's a cottage
 industry of those.
 I assume the illumination guys can even provide a theorem that, as drawn,
 its illuminable; they seem to be able to do this kind of stuff, but I dunno.
 The WP article also gives examples of unilluminable rooms, so if you limit
 yourself to "perfectly collisionless" motion, then the ergodic hypothesis
 fails.
 Collisions are required, for the ergodic hypothesis to apply.
 There are several ways of hand–waving this: for waves, one must have a
 [[resonant interaction]] to have ergodicity and mixing, and for quantum
 systems, one has to have a QM version thereof, involving either fermion-photon
 scattering, or four–particle scattering (four, because the QM version of
 the [[three-wave equation]] cannot conserve both energy and momentum (and
 particle–number, for a single field).
 Unless you're a gluon, in which case it can.
 But gluons are non–obvious, and anyway we don't have non–microscopic systems
 that behave like gluons, so three–particle scattering would have to be
 a very arcane example.

 It's trying to illustrate the ergodic hypothesis using some unusual geometry,

 i.e.
 that the gamma matrices are a kind of derivative (Lie derivative?) acting
