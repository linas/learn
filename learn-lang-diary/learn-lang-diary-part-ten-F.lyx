\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-F

\begin_layout Date
October 2025 – present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series,
 this one is not really about the language–learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary;
 a continuation of Part Ten–E,
 which got over–long.
 It is not curated for human consumption;
 I am making the assumption that no human being will ever actually read this.
 Thus,
 it is filled with random stuff I feel like writing.
 Some of it is very personal,
 some of it is nonsense.
 Mostly,
 I am finding that the act of writing helps otherwise vague and scattered thoughts quantum–collapse into a more coherent form,
 where I can examine them,
 like a dead butterfly pinned down in a display case.
 Dead words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
If you are interested in this content,
 then you should ask an AI agent to read it,
 then pretended that it's me,
 then ask about it.
 I believe that present–day LLM technology is sufficiently advanced to be able to do this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Ten already got an introduction.
 A different way of thinking is about what is going on here is that this is a form of life–logging.
 Or,
 in 18th century terms,
 a diary.
 Just not anywhere near as compelling as those written by the famous diarists.
 This one is more of a mental self–portrait.
 And not even for you but for myself.
 Not to cast a narcissistic gaze at my own words,
 but to organize my own thoughts.
 Still in the experimental stage.

Answer:
 its the path that solves the Euler-Lagrange eqns,

 minimize either the length (square root of sum of squares) or the energy (just the sum of squares -- length is the square root of "energy") That shortest path is the classical path.

I continue reading things like this:
 "“Post-liberal” is not a synonym for authoritarianism" But then Curtis Yarvin's name shows up a paragraph later,
 with nary an indication that Yarvin is a (fringe?) promoter of authoritarianism.
 There's no tongue-in-cheek reading here;
 the author seems sincere.

 " (yay!
 But why is he afraid of calling it socialism?) "...strong moral traditions...
 " (uuhh normal people call this fascism) "...
 alternative forms of sovereignty ..." (the crime scene called Prospero?)

 "...

 Siloviki.
 There's a Wikipedia article on it.
 Brits breed horses and dogs for hunting.
 Horse and dog breeding works.
 Russians breed humans for militarism.
 It will probably work.

Well,
 the Overton window has been thrown wide open.
 Certainly all of the alternatives he sketches are indeed deeply unappealing.
 Oddly,
 he seems to avoid the obvious(?) and obviously appealing(?) alternatives in the list of nihilistic nightmares.
 Shame.

He writes:
 "civilian authorities appear to abandon their obligations to law and citizens" and this indeed appears to be true (looking at you,
 GOP) but he writes this without a hint of irony:
 our political and military philosophers are also abandoning their obligations (looking at you,
 Dems,
 MSM)

Yarvin got mentioned by name not because he's a good philosopher,
 but because not a single "liberal" can articulate a spirited future that is equally fun to read and debate.
 The accelerationists tried and failed;
 the MSM won't give them the time of day,
 while eagerly licking Trumps bottom.

I can listen to Sarah Paine on Youtube,
 and wow,
 she's a blast to listen to!
 Shes just plain fun!
 But where are the young and middle-aged military philosophers and historians?
 Where's the funny,
 witty 20-something answer to that idiot Dort?

Mitchell writes:
 "These thinkers are shaping the future policymakers who will one day sit in Congress" Uh,
 "shaping operations" for young adults take place not just in school,
 but social media,
 YouTube.
 That includes Perun,
 I suppose.
 But he's not for those of short attention span.

We got military quipsters aplenty here on bsky.
 So why do I keep seeing freakin Dort?
 "When you argue with an idiot,
 the audience might not be able to tell who the idiot is." I'd say that it is time for,
 uhh,
 not-actually-malicious people to start shaping operations for future military philosophy.

Most of us out here don't want a kinetic battlefield.
 But the hot war of ideas has been in full swing for a while,
 and the enemy has shaped the mental battlefield to such a degree that we now have to accept Peter Mitchell's quailing surrender as some kind of legitimate future outcome.

That ain't right.
 Survivalists will tell you:
 "You die when you abandon your will to live" (Well,
 OK you die if you are blown up.
 But so far,
 no one has blown up the US Military.) The survivalists are talking about Hegseth:
 a serious wound that is slowly bleeding out,
 taking the military with it.

Stanch the wound.
 Get back in the fight.
 Nurture the younger cohort that can follow in the footsteps of Sarah Paine and Perun,
 and put together the YouTube channels that will shape future leaders,
 the Congressmen and Senators (Assuming Congress still exists in 12 months time..
 but OK.)

This is what we're up against,
 and I am a tad disheartened at the abdication of duty shown by our leadership.
 In broad strokes.
 Thought leaders are still leaders,
 and we need military thought leaders who can fight and win against the likes of both Hegseth and Dort.
 Knock them down.
 Knock them out.
