Troublesome statements:

Page 2: "Classical states are then ρ which are diagonal in the basis of X ."

    This is not correct. Consider the pure state |a>. The corresponding
    density operator is |a><a| which is clearly diagonal, but one would
    never call a pure state "classical"; it is just a pure state.

    I think the intent was to say something along the lines of
    "The observables of a classical system form a commutative
    C*-algebra" or perhaps "The observables of a classical system
    commute with density operators that are diagonal in the basis of X"

    This has knock-on effects into the definitions of CTC, CTQ etc.
    A channel is usually understood to be a map between C*-algebras;
    a classical channel is a map of a commutative C*-algebra.

    So I think the intended meaning here is something like this:
    "The space L(H) of linear operators on the Hilbert space H can
    be decomposed into four parts. Select a subspace of C ⊆ L(H)
    that is commutatitive; this is the "classical" subspace; the
    (orthogonal?) complement is the "quantum subspace" Q. The space
    channels Psi:L(H) -> L(H) then splits into CTC, CTQ, QTC, QTQ
    which are the maps between these subspaces."

    I think that is the intent. Now, in general, there won't be
    commutative subspaces, unless you explicitly make it so; so
    for example, I think you want the space H = C^|Σ|⊗ R^|Σ| where
    R^|Σ| is real Euclidean space, used to model the space of classical
    registers, C^|Σ| is used for the quantum states, and now the
    collection of automorphisms of the C*-algebra L(H) to itself
    splits into the desired CTC, CTQ, QTC, QTQ parts, which are just
    CTC:L(R^|Σ|) -> L(R^|Σ|)  and CTQ:L(R^|Σ|) -> L(C^|Σ|)
    and QTC:L(C^|Σ|) -> L(R^|Σ|) and QTQ:L(C^|Σ|) -> L(C^|Σ|)

    This is my best guess as to the intent of these defintions but
    perhaps I misunderstood or garbled something here.
    
    It should be pointed out here that the state transition functions
    of an (ordinary) finite state machine are not linear. However, by
    using the formalism of a probabilistic automaton, you can make it
    linear (and every finite classical Turing machine has a finite
    state machine equivalent.) Then I think what you are shooting for
    in the quantum half is the "quantum finite automaton". See
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_finite_automaton and
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_automaton
    I think these two articles describe the intended split of the
    computation into classical and quantum "registers".

    I have never actually contemplated combining these two descriptions
    into a single unified C*-algebra, and it would be perhaps a good
    exercise to confirm that the detailed formalisms all pass through
    exactly as intended (i.e. as direct products, semi-direct products,
    tensor products, etc. in all those places where they would need to
    appear.)

    Sections 3 and 4 on pages 3-5 are recapitulations of standard
    textbook material; it would have been nice if instead this space
    was devoted to articulating the details of the unified description
    of quantum and proabilistic automata.

    Sections 3 and 4 are also mis-labelled: they have nothing to do
    with AGI, or even with computing: they summarize standard school
    curriculum for physics, with the three letters AGI sprinkled in. 
    The space could have beeter been devoted to making contact with
    e.g. the theory of automata, and then asserting "AGI will be on
    a substrate of these kinds of automata"

Section 5ff.
    This section attempts to pack too much material in too small a
    space. The use of jargon does not help. For example, page 5, bottom:

    "In CAGI it equals a quadratic loss surface over an information
     manifold."

    I think this is trying to say what the next sentence says: the
    classical mutual information is given by the Fisher metric. And
    yes, metrics are quadratic. The location of the "surface" is
    unclear. And the word "loss" has a specific technical meaning in
    deep learning neural nets, where it refers to the Gibbs measure.
    Sure, I suppose one can relate the Gibbs measure "loss" to, I guess,
    some gaussian on some astract Wiener space or something like that,
    but unpacking all this could be a short paper in itself. Condensing
    it like this will leave almost all readers confused.

Top of page 6:
    "Classical form (HC ind)."
    "Given data D = {(si, ri)}N i=1, model fθ , weights λ"

This is a category error!!!

    What's s_i? What's r_i? The  model fθ appears to be a
    "parametric predictor with weights θ and sample-weights λi;"

    This appears to be some sort of Hamiltonian expression that might
    possibly be used for parametric predictive modelling, e.g. to train
    some deep learning neural net. But there are several issues here:

    -- Why has the conversation moved to parametric predictive modelling?
    Is there some claim that AGI will consist of some agents, and those
    agents will be using parametric predictive modelling to form a
    world-model? What about all those people doing non-parametric
    modelling? Are they out of luck?

    -- Is there a claim that *all* agents must necessarily create a
    world model that is obtained with this specific Hamiltonian form?
    Might there be some other Hamiltonian form?

    -- Is this formula supposed to be immediately recognizable to
    readers who do predictive modelling? If I quint, then it does look
    to be perhaps something that might be used in gradient-descent-ish
    type training algorithms,
