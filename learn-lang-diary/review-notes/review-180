Review for Submission 180

Troublesome statements:
-----------------------
Page 2: "Classical states are then ρ which are diagonal in the basis of X ."
    This is not correct. Consider the pure state |a>. The corresponding
    density operator is |a><a| which is clearly diagonal, but one would
    never call a pure state "classical"; it is just a pure state.

    I think the intent was to say something along the lines of
    "The observables of a classical system form a commutative
    C*-algebra" or perhaps "The observables of a classical system
    commute with density operators that are diagonal in the basis of X"

    This has knock-on effects into the definitions of CTC, CTQ etc.
    A channel is usually understood to be a map between C*-algebras;
    a classical channel would then correspond to a map of some
    commutative subalgebra of the C*-algebra.

    So I think the intended meaning here is somethig like this:
    "The space L(H) of linear operators on the Hilbert space H can
    be decomposed into four parts. Select a subspace of C ⊆ L(H)
    that is commutatitive; this is the "classical" subspace; the
    (orthogonal?) complement is the "quantum subspace" Q. The space
    channels Psi:L(H) -> L(H) then splits into CTC, CTQ, QTC, QTQ
    which are the maps between these subspaces."
    


Typos:
------
Page 1 first paragraph: spurious whitespace in "architect ed"
Page 1 missing references: "ontology [?, ?, ?, 4, 8, 20]"
       "of these operators [?]."
       "contextuality [?,3],"

Page 2 "agents and agent are described"
       "We define a Hilbert space X = C|Σ|" -- I assume C is meant to
       stand for the complex numbers. Please use \mathbf{C} to avoid
       ambiguity.
