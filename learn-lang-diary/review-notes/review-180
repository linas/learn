Troublesome statements:
-----------------------
Page 2: "Classical states are then ρ which are diagonal in the basis of X ."

    This is not correct. Consider the pure state |a>. The corresponding
    density operator is |a><a| which is clearly diagonal, but one would
    never call a pure state "classical"; it is just a pure state.

    I think the intent was to say something along the lines of
    "The observables of a classical system form a commutative
    C*-algebra" or perhaps "The observables of a classical system
    commute with density operators that are diagonal in the basis of X"

    This has knock-on effects into the definitions of CTC, CTQ etc.
    A channel is usually understood to be a map between C*-algebras;
    a classical channel is a map of a commutative C*-algebra.

    So I think the intended meaning here is something like this:
    "The space L(H) of linear operators on the Hilbert space H can
    be decomposed into four parts. Select a subspace of C ⊆ L(H)
    that is commutatitive; this is the "classical" subspace; the
    (orthogonal?) complement is the "quantum subspace" Q. The space
    channels Psi:L(H) -> L(H) then splits into CTC, CTQ, QTC, QTQ
    which are the maps between these subspaces."

    I think that is the intent. Now, in general, there won't be
    commutativve subspaces, unless you explicitly add them; so
    for example, I think you want the space H = C^|Σ|⊗ R^|Σ| where
    R^|Σ| is real Euclidean space, used to model the space of classical
    registers, C^|Σ| is used for the quantum states, and now the
    collection of automorphisms of the C*-algebra L(H) to itself
    splits into the desired CTC, CTQ, QTC, QTQ parts, which are just
    CTC:L(R^|Σ|) -> L(R^|Σ|)  and CTQ:L(R^|Σ|) -> L(C^|Σ|)
    and QTC:L(C^|Σ|) -> L(R^|Σ|) and QTQ:L(C^|Σ|) -> L(C^|Σ|)

    This is my best guess as to the intent of these defintions but
    perhaps I misunderstood or garbled something here.
