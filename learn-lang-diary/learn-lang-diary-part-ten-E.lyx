\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-E
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
June 2025 – present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language–learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten–D, which got
 over–long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am making the assumption that
 no human being will ever actually read this.
 Thus, it is filled with random stuff I feel like writing.
 Some of it is very personal, some of it is nonsense.
 Mostly, I am finding that the act of writing helps otherwise vague and
 scattered thoughts quantum–collapse into a more coherent form, where I
 can examine them, like a dead butterfly pinned down in a display case.
 Dead words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
If you are interested in this content, then you should ask an AI agent to
 read it, then pretended that it's me, then ask about it.
 I believe that present–day LLM technology is sufficiently advanced to be
 able to do this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Ten already got an introduction.
 A different way of thinking is about what is going on here is that this
 is a form of life–logging.
 Or, in 18th century terms, a diary.
 Just not anywhere near as compelling as those written by the famous diarists.
 This one is more of a mental self–portrait.
 And not even for you but for myself.
 Not to cast a narcissistic gaze at my own words, but to organize my own
 thoughts.
 Still in the experimental stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
4 June 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once more into the breach.
 So I really should write up here–and–now formally, because I think I have
 good results that are worth stating publicly.
 I am, however, stuck with thermalization.
 This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs.
 I've been fumbling with some ideas, but they break apart before I get very
 far.
 I think I wrote a to–do list task before, but let me try again:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Given some graph, what can be said about the (eigenvalue) spectrum of that
 graph? Presumably, the set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all graphs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be divided into distinct regions, with first and second–order phase
 transitions between these regions.
 What kind of a research program has the power to create this map? I can
 certainly start by doing some experimental work, I guess, but this is a
 major project.
 Explore a collection of small graphs.
 Some regular graphs e.g.
 grids.
 Random graphs with various typical statistical properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do the wave–vector work.
 Where I last left this was that there should be wave–vectors associated
 with graph automorphisms.
 Some automorphism groups will be abelian – e.g.
 those for conventional solid–state physics on crystalline lattices.
 Others will be non–abelian, I have no clue what those are, and making progress
 seems to require brute force work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The graph approach to thermalization then suggests that the 3D structure
 of space might be emergent.
 That the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

actual
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 quantum world may live on some graph or hypergraph structure (we can vectorize
 hypergraphs into graphs, thanks to tensoring.) And the 3D structure of space
 may in fact be some phase–transition boundary, some critical point, where
 graphs on one side fail to have a spectrum that gives thermalization, and
 graphs on the other side do.
 This makes space emergent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What about spacetime? Is space–time emergent? The core graph model still
 has a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 that appears as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{n}\tau}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}$
\end_inset

 one of the eigenvalues, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 looks a lot like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, the Renninger setup emphasizes that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 will map to many distinct and different values of lab–frame proper time,
 so that different space–time regions in different parts of the lab, correspond
 to the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, but just in different parts of the graph.
 So if my graph is 
\begin_inset Formula $G=G_{L}\otimes B\otimes G_{R}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 the narrow bridge, and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 the large thermal tanks, then states on 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 evolved as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{n}\tau}$
\end_inset

 even though 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to one side of the lab, in the lab–frame–proper–time past of
 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 is another spatial region, in the lab–frame–proper–time future of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

.
 So, in this sense, time is also emergent, but it seems that also lab–frame
 proper–time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 maps to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 linearly.
 Well, more strongly: well, denote 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}$
\end_inset

 as the lab–frame proper time in 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and likewise for 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}$
\end_inset

 and thus I hypothesize that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}-t_{L}=\mbox{const.}>0$
\end_inset

 so that proper time runs at constant speed in both halves, because they
 are stationary with respect to one–another.
 i.e.
 no relativistic time dilation.
 And more: that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}-\tau=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}-\tau=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 really is the proper time in the rest frame, even though in some parts
 of the lab, it's in the future, and some parts of the lab, its in the past.
 This is for the Renninger setup, where the detectors are strictly time–like
 ordered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For the Clauser–Aspect–Zeilinger type setup, where the left and right sides
 of the lab are space–like separated when the measurements are made, then
 it is not legal to talk about 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}-t_{L}$
\end_inset

 because if the issue of selecting a space–like surface on which to define
 these two.
 However, we must still have that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}-\tau=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}-\tau=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 and, in a certain sense, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}=t_{R}$
\end_inset

 because these space–like separated regions are both happening at the same
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 That is, both 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 are happening at the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, even though they are space–like separated from one–another.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the here–and–now parameter.
 It does not (cannot) specify a space–like surface, because for the Renninger
 setup, it becomes time–like, even though 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is still the same here–and–now parameter.
 So, in this sense, space–time is emergent from the graph, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 can be recognized as advancing at speed one in the lab rest frame, and
 thus identifiable as proper time, even though it cannot be used to order
 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

, because both 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 are at the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, irrespective of whether 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 are space–like or time–like separated in the lab.
 I think this all makes sense, but clearly I am struggling with algebraic
 formalities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How it is that the Minkowski structure of space–time emerges from the 
\begin_inset Formula $G=G_{L}\otimes B\otimes G_{R}$
\end_inset

 structure is entirely unclear.
 Perhaps there have to be many bridges 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 connecting many sub–graphs.
 So this then becomes a question: what's the tensor algebra decomposition
 if we have some regions like 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 that are densely connected, and a bunch of thin bridges connecting these
 dense parts? Under what circumstances with a 3+1 decomposition arise for
 such graphs? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I kick back here, and here's the train of thought.
 I would like to ask an LLM how to thermalize, but they are too stupid to
 answer that question.
 Because the LLM's don't understand graph theory, algebra, tensors, none
 of that.
 Nor can they run experiments on matrices.
 I can't ask the LLM to compute the eigenvalues of things, and then to fiddle
 the algebra for me, and do it again.
 Search for phase transitions on large graphs.
 I want to automate my science experiment.
 But how?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I would like to build an algebra explorer.
 Now, mathematicians have developed plenty of theorem–proving tools.
 I think I know how those go, I don't yet see how to leverage them.
 Should I build an algebra system founded on Atomese, as the substrate?
 Yes, I probably should.
 Should I combine it with the current ideas about agency and evidence? Yes,
 I should.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did have a chance to recap the story of MOSES for someone, yesterday,
 and recapping that, I got to review the issues associated with recursive
 self–improvement that were hit by MOSES.
 There are many issues.
 One serious issue was the use of an objective function which was to be
 optimized.
 This is doomed, it's a paperclip–maximizer.
 The accretion–agglomeration concept of perception and agency is the only
 plausible replacement that I have for that.
 One of the issues was that, when looking at MOSES as an explorer of a search
 space, that search space grows combinatorially with the program complexity.
 It explodes, out of control, and the learning curves plateau out, because
 the terrain becomes locally very flat, there's no gradient to climb.
 This is something we already know from natural selection: the solution
 space looks like a golf–course: a large expanse of nearly flat territory:
 noise, mostly, disturbing the flatness.
 And after a long and difficult search, you find the hole.
 Sink the golf–ball, and now you emerge on a new terrain, that is much much
 bigger than before.
 Ugh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The accretion–agglomeration model avoids this.
 Instead, you are sticking parts onto other parts, and yes, of course, there
 are ever–more possibilities, but who cares? Stick them together, and see
 if the result is functional...
 what does it mean to be functional? Well, maybe this is the other road–block.
 If you have an agent in an environment, all it can do is go out there and
 play.
 It plays, it learns a few things.
 Gets more sophisticated at playing ...
 and then what? Ugh.
 The universe it inhabits is a dream–world, it wanders through this universe,
 exhibiting curiosity and playfulness, but mostly hallucinating what it
 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

out there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the universe, as opposed to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in here
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inside the agent.
 But perhaps I am personifying too much.
 The agent is more like that critical sandpile, accreting new experiences
 and information, sloughing off in avalanches, both of the universe and
 in the universe, with a boundary between the two that is both clear–cut
 and also ambiguous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever.
 This is a nice model of agency.
 Should I build it? Just earlier, I wanted an algebraic system.
 So I guess what I really want is an agent that can wander through the space
 of algebra.
 How can I build that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I want 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

like an LLM, but for algebra
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but I don't want an LLM literally, because I don't want to train it on
 algebra, I want it to discover algebra.
 So, in some sense, an axiom–explorer.
 Generate a collection of axioms, treat these as jigsaw pieces, then randomly
 assemble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So lets try this with the axioms of set theory? Step one: how do I encode
 the axioms of set theory as jigsaws? Step two: how do I generate novel
 combinations? Perhaps the universe of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

out there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 needs to be the collection of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all possible jigsaws
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (aka 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all possible axioms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and the agent is an explorer that attempts to grab these, and assemble
 them.
 What does it mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

to assemble
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Well, conventionally, these are proofs – collisions of axioms that can
 be assembled, and then eventually terminate.
 For conventional mathematics, they terminate in true/false.
 I suppose true and false can be considered to be jigsaws themselves.
 A characteristic of proofs is that they start with small theorems, blow
 up large in the middle of the proof, and then terminate.
 I suspect what I really want is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reverse mathematics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, start with nothing, let the thing blow up, and then wait for it to become
 small again: to reduce.
 The result off the reduction is now the theorem.
 The theorem can now be added to the collection of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

known things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The collection of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

known things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are then used during generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, generation can be viewed as a kind of exploration.
 What is the difference, really, between MOSES–style genetic generation,
 and, say exhaustive generation, such as odometers (Markov odometers, etc.)
 and just, I dunno ...
 random accretion...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is the dictionary of accumulated knowledge, well, nominally, it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

internal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the agent, but to the generator, it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

external
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: it is a place where the agent can get things, and put things (i.e.
 get things that represent axioms and theorems, and put new theorems when
 they are discovered.
 So, its memory.
 It's memory exclusive to the agent, i.e.
 incorruptible by other agents working in the external world.
 In a multi–agent system, one will want to have a common, shared memory,
 when multiple agents can contribute new discoveries.
 Unlike the private memory, this risks 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

corruption
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or unexpected changes.
 Of course, the external memory is a communications channel between agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wonder if I should use the pi–calculus as the API to memory.
 it is certainly a minimal model for a multi–agent communications system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then my thoughts zoom off again.
 The pi–calculus can also be used as..
 well, suppose we have communication over links, on graphs ...
 Can I look at pi–calculus as some fragment of linear logic?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which runs me back into a circle: the classical world is a Cartesian category,
 the quantum world is the dagger–symmetric category; these are known fragments,
 that is, monoidal categories with some additional axioms.
 Which I could try to work out by hand, being careful to articulate what's
 the same, what's different.
 Perhaps these axioms assemble in a way that resemble Ext and Tor.
 There are just such a large variety of analogies that can be made, that
 can be imagined, some of which are maybe widely useful, some maybe dead–ends,
 and it is very tempting to be the olde–school mathematician and tackle
 these with pencil and paper, when in fact I recognize an axiomatic system
 that should be explored using a generative apparatus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So maybe I should just say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fuck it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and start writing code to implement the vision above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before I do that, how much time should I sped trying to imagine a structural
 encoding in terms of binary strings?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I want to bootstrap this, and get to self–modifying ASAP.
 How? Is pi–calculus a place to start?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is that premature?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should I experiment with a specific task? Should I create a system that
 can do eigenvector solving on a graph, and let it then explore algebraic
 variants, and thereby maybe discover number fields or something like that?
 Of course, if it does do this, how do I attach this back to the English
 language? I need to talk to it.
 If it discovers a well–known mathematical concept, I certainly do NOT want
 to try to read through the axioms and figure out what it was.
 So I also need the evidence–solver, to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

these two things are probably the same.
 Except, for pure math, I need to have it work 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

absolutely, certainly the same
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and not fuzzy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...
 and so I need the unifier.
 Unification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crap.
 Where to start.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I need a connector–upper.
 Except the existing query engine can do that.
 Except it has a complicated syntax.
 So its like re–inventing lisp: step one: what is the most minimal system?
 Step two? How can I create a description of the minimal system, so that
 reasoning can be performed on it? That is, how do I create a minimal system
 that is self–describing? I have lots of parts I can use; how do I ...
 ??? Step four: Profit!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I need to reinvent the URE, but doing it correctly, this time ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I want to have a gas of rules, with some ..
 Boltzmann distribution, and then have it do self–chemistry, evolutionary
 chemistry on itself.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

memory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the collection of molecules that get discovered.
 But what of the combinatoric explosion?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somehow, RNN's got past the combinatoric explosion.
 How? Well, for starters, RNN's are trained; there's an objective function,
 they're trying to minimize it.
 But I don't have an objective function; I just have an agent that wants
 to try all possibilities.
 How can I get agents to team up? I can imagine each node in an RNN diagram,
 the attention heads, whatever, as an individual agent, and each one tried
 to hook up somehow with the other agents, accepting inputs and delivering
 outputs...
 who hooks these up? How is the data pumped? Whence does the data come from?
 I've got pipes carrying data.
 The recursive step is to have pipes carrying pipes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RNN used a vector encoding.
 Symbols were sprayed onto an n–dimensional sphere, uniformly.
 Then symbol sequences ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
6 June 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thought about the wave vectors in the middle of the night, while tossing
 and turning.
 It's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not that hard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, even if the symmetry group of the graph is non–abelian.
 Keywords are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal subgroup
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

group center
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So, for example, imagine the group has as a subgroup the cyclic group 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Corresponding to this will be a collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 eigenfunctions, having the form 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\pi km/n}$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th atom in the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th harmonic.
 Just basic standing–wave harmonics on a necklace with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 beads.
 The energy (eigenvalue) of each mode will be 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{k}$
\end_inset

 with higher 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 being higher energy: these will not be degenerate eigenmodes.
 However, the eigenmodes will be degenerate, in general, depending on the
 divisibility of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 So, for example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is divisible by four, and we consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $k=4$
\end_inset

'th harmonic, there will be 
\begin_inset Formula $n/4$
\end_inset

 distinct eigenmodes, offset by a phase factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $1,e^{i\pi k/n},e^{i\pi2k/n},\cdots$
\end_inset

 obtained by rotating the ring, i.e.
 by restarting the numbering of the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th atom by 
\begin_inset Formula $0,1,2,\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 These are orthogonal.
 All of them are degenerate, having the same energy.
 The generator of the cyclic group 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 can be envisioned as a displacement: it just rotates the necklace by one
 step.
 This generator just carries the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|k,p\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 eigenfunction to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|k,p+1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 eigenfunction, for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le p<n/k$
\end_inset

.
 Instead of using words, I guess I should use formulas: the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th atom has 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle m\vert k,p\right\rangle =e^{i\pi k\left(m+p\right)/n}=e^{i\pi km/n}e^{i\pi kp/n}=e^{i\pi kp/n}\left\langle m\vert k,0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever.
 The point is that for each cyclic subgroup of the symmetry group, there's
 an associated subset of the eigenvectors that are characterized by a collection
 of orthogonal modes of this conventional standing–wave form, that are character
ized by a momentum wave–vector that is some integral multiple of the length
 of that cyclic subgroup.
 There's also the energy, the eigenvalue for each mode.
 What is not clear is the dispersion relation that connects the two.
 Is it linear? Does it have the form of a quadratic polynomial, i.e.
 having the form 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{2}=a_{1}p_{1}^{2}+a_{2}p_{2}^{2}+\cdots+m^{2}$
\end_inset

 for constants 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},a_{2,}\cdots,m^{2}$
\end_inset

? Or is it some polynomial with higher order terms? I guess it could be
 something else entirely...
 although a characterization in terms of the cyclic subgroups remains key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For large random graphs with 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{23}$
\end_inset

 vertices in them, what is the distribution of the graph automorphism groups?
 What does it mean to have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a random graph
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Getting the automorphism group is hard.
 What about the homology groups of the graph? How are they distributed?
 Is there a relation between the homology groups, and the automorphism group?
 For every homology group of higher order, I can imagine a collection of
 harmonics on that group.
 How do those harmonics tie into the spectrum? I don't recall seeing anything
 that touches on such questions.
 I guess I should ask some LLM to see if it knows anything about stuff like
 this.
 Which is more work, more reading.
 The other possibility is to just make an exhaustive list of small graphs,
 and see if a pattern emerges...
 when? When will I have time to do this?

I want to revist certain portions of as–moses.

LTN Logic Tensor Networks has a DL/NN structure.

\begin_layout Standard
While I search for that tab to refresh my memory, I glance at the model–context–
protocol page, and am reminded that I need an MCP for the atomspace, to
 talk about what is in there.
 A demo tutorial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LTN is here: https://github.com/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks It
 is actually kind–of useless.
 It embeds atomic constants as vectors, predicates as matrices or tensors,
 and atomic formulas as graphs.
 Logic connectives use fuzzy semantics, quantifiers are aggregates, the
 whole mess is converted to tensorflow graphs.
 See the README there for more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is this useless? Well, because the list of logic connectives is hard–coded
 – and, or, not, implies.
 The variables are hard–coded as lists of possible individuals, quantifiers
 are hard–coded as mean.
 And the whole thing is pushed into tensorflow.
 which is maybe the only interesting thing, since it provides a mapping
 of predicate logic into a funky fuzzy NN logic.
 Which is ...
 interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, lets compare to PLN.
 The idea of PLN was to do forward chaining, backward chaining, etc.
 to find logical inferences, given a collection of inference rules given
 in the PLN book.
 So the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to do would be to ..
 well create an automatic chainer, and then convert the chain into LTN–style
 tensorflow networks.
 Except that, of course, we want to use MOSES–style tree decorations instead
 of chainers.
 And we want to use not MOSES decorators, but a generic jigsaw random assembly
 system.
 And I have been stuck at exactly this point for years.
 Some kind of ...
 mental block, I know what I want I seem unable to get it.
 Cue Sex Pistols for the refrain.
 The jigsaws are ...
 link–grammar disjuncts.
 I tried ten years ago with the Viterbi parser, which ran out of CPU and
 was slow.
 The LG parser is fast.
 So ...
 what's the problem?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where do I begin? I have a cascade ot tasks here.
 I need to organize them into priority.

 I'm tired, now.

\begin_layout Subsection*

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, the above got me so excited, I could not fall asleep.
 I fought the urge to get up and work on it all night.
 I could not find the usual mindset that would nock me out, sleeping.
 Perhaps I drank too much coffee the day before, but I doubt it.
 I also resumed taking magnesium threonate, the second time after a month
 not taking it, and maybe that kept me awake.
 I've noticed that hard thinking makes me sleepy, so I thought I'd work
 on a boring math problem in my head, till that knocked me out.
 Took a while, but it did.
 And thus, first thing this morning, instead of working on the above, I
 has some minor math results to report.
 Crap.
 Here goes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the math problem is to find the eigenvalues of the fully connected graph.
 The clique graph.
 The Hamiltonian for oscillators that interact via graph edges.
 This has the Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 with 1 on the diagonal and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 for all off–diagonal entries.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{ij}=\delta_{ij}+\epsilon\left(1-\delta_{ij}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 For small 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

, the rows and columns are already almost orthonormal.
 Geometrically, the rows and columns form an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

–cube, a bit sheared and compressed along the diagonal 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{0}=\left[1,1,\cdots,1\right]=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}e_{k}$
\end_inset

, and completely rotationally symmetric about this axis.
 The eigenvalue is 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{0}=1+\left(n-1\right)\epsilon$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $Hv_{0}=E_{0}v_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The remaining eigenvectors are all degenerate, and have the energy 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}=1-\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 The rotational symmetry gives a large choice for picking the eigenvectors.
 It will be convenient to set 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}=e_{0}-e_{k}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in\left\{ 1,\cdots,n-1\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 This gives 
\begin_inset Formula $Hv_{k}=E_{1}v_{k}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

 are not orthonormal.
 Although 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{0}\cdot v_{k}=n\delta_{k0}$
\end_inset

 we do have 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}\cdot v_{j}=1$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j>0$
\end_inset

.
 I didn't notice this while sleeping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, we want to entangle 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{0}$
\end_inset

 with a Renninger photon, or a Clauser–Aspect–Zeilinger doublet.
 For now, lets just hit it with a hammer.
 That is, decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{0}$
\end_inset

 into a superposition.
 For this, note that 
\begin_inset Formula $ne_{0}=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}v_{k}$
\end_inset

, and so by normalizing appropriately, we find that hitting 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{0}$
\end_inset

 with a hammer excites all the modes.
 They're not normal modes, because I screwed up and did not orthogonalize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, what was interesting was asking the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how long before recurrence?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 given that each state evolves as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{1}t}$
\end_inset

 and the diagonal as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{0}t}$
\end_inset

? Well, for my non–orthonormal basis, the answer is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

really fast.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 And so for the Renninger setup, if one tank is a clique of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 oscillators and the other is of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 oscillators, connected by a single edge, then the wave function 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

collapses
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into one tank, then 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

uncollapses
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and goes into the other tank, resonating at some ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $m/n$
\end_inset

.
 And of course, this is what we expect, given that the system is in a whole
 completely linear; there's no non–linear dissipative term, and we're dealing
 with the problem of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wigner's friend
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 But I knew that coming in, the goal was to ...
 I dunno.
 Think about this till I fell asleep.
 And so there we are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other thoughts were abut what if 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is small but random for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\ne j$
\end_inset

, and what if 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is tri–diagonal (a linear chain, but we know that already) and I look at
 the edges as defining 1-simplexes, and triangles as 2-simplexes, then what
 if the graph is constructed to have 3-simplexes only? i.e.
 a cell complex of dimension 3, a piece–wise tessellation of a 3-manifold?
 I don't know the answers.
 But again, since we're always dealing with a linear system, its always
 Wigner's friend.
 Nothing is evaded here.
 Still, interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coda: The issue is that points 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{k}t}\left|k\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 always live on an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

–torus, and at best those orbits become dense on the torus if the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{k}$
\end_inset

 are pair–wise irrational.
 Which makes them barely ergodic, and certainly not mixing.
 If we hope to do better, we need some deformation of that torus.
 Or perhaps abandon the lab–frame Newtonian pseudo–time, so different paths
 can arrive at the same point with different times.
 The obvious candidates, special and general relativity are covariant.
 If curvature can be used to generate mixing, its far beyond the intellectual
 apparatus I've set up so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, time to get back to coding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
13 June 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Been using Claude Code for the last week or so, and I have to say that it
 is actually pretty good with what it does ..
 at least, if you have it set up with the correct prompt.
 My first round of attempts with using plain–old web–based Claude, and it
 made a total hash of things, I spent all day trying to create a functional
 pyproject.toml for the AtomSpace, and it kept generating broken crap, and
 then apologizing every time.
 It would have been faster for me to just read the docs, and do it myself.
 Which is slow, tedious and painful, because I'm human and my rate of thinking
 is very limited.
 ...
 However ...
 with the right prompts...
 Levi has a Claude.md that has very explicit instructions about doing everything,
 not taking short–cuts, reading the docs in full, double–checking, writing
 unit tests, making sure the unit tests pass, etc etc.
 32KB of explicit instructions, 1K lines, and when Claude reads that, then
 the code that it generates seems to be of high quality.
 So far.
 I still have very limited experience, having created maybe a dozen files,
 half in python, half in C++, but it seems to be good stuff.
 I am keeping a careful eye over it.
 The fiddly bits I am doing myself, this was for the cogserver.
 Claude wrote the boilerplate, but I manually plugged it into place.
 I doubt it would have been able to plug it in correctly; I figured it would
 take too much time to explain how I want it done, so I did that part myself.
 But still, for the limited tasks so far, I'm impressed.
 It seems to be a useful coding tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I'm using it to create an MCP server for the cogserver that will be able
 to access the AtomSpace.
 So this is kind–of useless, but its a proof–of–concept, to show that ...
 MCP can be used to talk to the atomspace.
 Creating individual atoms by talking to claude would be pointlessly inefficient
, but perhaps ...
 I dunno, maybe I'll be able to teach claude how to create complex structures.
 Maybe.
 That was not the original intent, this just popped in my head as I was
 writing this.
 The original intent was to move forward on the ideas re moses+ltn+lg ideas
 from the 10 June entry above.
 That will require a lot of heavy lifting and design, but maybe with Claude,
 I'll be able to get it done...
 Clearly, no one else is going to help me with this, Ben is utterly disintereste
d, none of the coders in that sphere are intellectually capable of advancing
 this.
 But Claude is compliant and patient.
 Maybe not exactly smart, but it seems like it will be able to create usable
 systems much faster than I could if I typed by hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Last night, I realized that my mode of work tends to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in the flow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I don't think much, I just flow.
 So, when designing new systems, I spend ten minutes or half an hour or
 whatever, decide how to do something, and then spend hours or all day doing
 it, just coding.
 And coding is just mindless work – just surfing, not thinking.
 Its both fun and unrewarding – it feels like doing cross–word puzzles.
 You solve the puzzle, but have little to show for it, other than some working
 code, and it took all day to do it.
 Claude upends this.
 Claude does the coding grunt–work.
 I will now have to think at a higher abstraction level? Perhaps working
 at that level will again turn back into flow, where I mostly just fiddle
 trying to get Claude to do the right thing.
 But still, it seems like I will be able to design more sophisticated systems
 more quickly.
 Well see.
 Hang on, I have to break and see what Claude has done.
 Be right back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yeah, no.
 Claude does good work, but is slow–going.
 Error prone, gets confused, breaks stuff.
 Resulting code is not optimal and quite ugly at times.
 Alas.

\begin_layout Standard
While sleeping, I worked on the orthogonal clique eigenvector problem.
 Obvious ideas like sines and cosines don't work.
 What I eventually settled on was a Walsh or Hadamard style basis vectors.
 For N=5, these are (1,-1,0,0,0) and (0,0,1,-1,0) and (1,1,-1,-1,0) and
 (1,1,1,1,-4) with obvious generalizations for all N.
 Acceptable for even N, the odd N case makes me wonder if there is a more
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

symmetric
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 variant.
 I'm glimpsing how to construct that now, but I've ran out of time and have
 more important things to do right now.
 Still, a mildly curious teaser.

 It's like time stopped.

\begin_layout Standard
Rave museum? WTF? So there's a stage ad an audience, and that's one of the
 main topics of debate: is the documentation of raves in Lithuania, 1992–2004
 a museum–worthy topic? And of course, the answer is yes, as otherwise I
 would not be here.
 So, for me, this is again the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is it, that is worth doing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and bless the Lithuanians, they seem to arrive at the right answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I guess you could do this in American culture, but there, anything
 goes, so you can do anything, and nothing is surprising.
 Here, the boundaries are more distinct.
 So last nights meditation was on behavioral boundaries.
 To recap: its the same meditation I always have.
 Rave dancing (the museum included art pieces, videos of dancers, not documentar
y, but in a studio, for the camera.
 White background, white light.) Rave dancing is acceptable in certain social
 situations.
 One of the museum pieces includes two dancers, live, perhaps trained ballet
 dancers, I don't know, in a dark, fog–filled room, moving slowly and striking
 poses.
 High Art, High Concept Art.
 A museum piece in a museum setting.
 You can also move like this in a dance studio, a yoga studio, maybe a gym,
 if you make it look like yoga, but you can't do this walking down the street,
 unless you are pretending to be a street performer.
 So in the US, you have dance boys: if you wanted to do that, it was break
 dancing.
 That's how you break the boundaries of social acceptability: you do it
 in private, with like–minded groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that's the reason I write this diary.
 The insight, the idea I did not have last night, but only now, as I write.
 New social behaviors must be birthed in private groups: unleashing this
 stuff on the unsuspecting public is too much.
 Being crazy is not socially acceptable.
 Well, clearly being a criminal is not acceptable.
 So there are actual limits that really should not be passed.
 Sort of.
 Attila the Hun, and the marauding Hoardes clearly behaved within the norms
 of their own in–group, even as modern culture would find this reprehensible
 if fascinating.
 We also read books about serial killers, and watch TV police proceedurals
 not just as an ordinary thing, but even as a popular things.
 On the plane, I watched Season 1, Episodes 1,2,3 of High Potential.
 The series opener if great: quite fun, a joy to watch, the lead actress
 is a treat for the eyes.
 By episode three, I'm at OK, I get the formula.
 They did not quite leave enough there to want me to see more.
 Which violates a binge–watch rule: add something unexpected with every
 episode.
 Like, Lost was WTF with each episode.
 It gave real material to sink your teeth into.
 A polar bear in the jungle? Whatever, I digress.
 But maybe there is no real point.
 Criminals do exist, their behavior we really do consider to be unacceptable.
 We have drawn boundaries.
 Criminals are commonplace, there is no shortage, and its not rare.
 We are victimized all the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So perhaps the development of culture is the discovery of boundaries between
 acceptable and unacceptable behavior? I can talk about this in abstract
 terms, because of the billions who participate in the process, via TikTok
 and Youtube.
 In a rural village 150 years ago, the refinement was limited by population
 size.
 So there's some scaling law, there.
 I do not (yet?) know how to assign a numerical value to cultural development,
 but clearly, there's a scaling w.r.t.
 population size.
 Probably with network connectivity.
 Well, that, and free time: the fabled tropical birds have so much free
 time to develop their culture that they have selectively bred it into their
 DNA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what am I doing here, really? I am writing down my thoughts, creating
 my own intellectual self–portrait.
 But I am also being bored by my own thoughts.
 Everything I wrote above is not particularly challenging, and presumably
 been explored more more deeply, and articulated to some finer degree, in
 some sociology textbook.
 What am I dong here? Amateur sociology, rediscovering the obvious, from
 scratch.
 What should I be doing? Well, clearly, I have no time for reading 100 books
 on sociology.
 But what if I did? What if I had that time? What would change? I would
 still be sitting here, writing about something, being pleasantly surprised
 when a new idea manifested, but otherwise submerged in the self–doubt of
 wondering what I'm doing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is this any different than rave dancing? Does it matter how I move my body?
 Thousands have moved it exactly the same way before, and professional ballet
 dancers will do it better than I ever could.
 But I can dance, because there is immediate pleasurable feedback.
 There is neural circuitry that provides the required reinforcement.
 And I don't dance in despair, thinking: oh there are others who dance so
 much better than I.
 And street philosophers do not despair that there are academic philosophers
 who are so much better.
 They go and they do.
 And so here, by analogy, I go and do, i.e.
 I write, and the fact that my observations into human psychology are shallow
 should really have no bearing on things.
 And yet, and yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's the rub: the meta question is, what should I spend my time doing?
 And the answer is perhaps that this is not worthy of my efforts.
 The so–called high–achievement individuals have a talent for selecting
 activities that are socially acclaimed as being of great merit.
 Me personally, this is something I've been blind to, I've ignored.
 To my detriment? Not obviously so.
 To my social standing? Why yes, clearly: I do not have big titles, big
 responsibilities or a big job.
 To my ability to do what I do now? I don't know.
 What do I do now? Some mish–mash of math and sociology in some attempt
 to understand the nature of thought, and the nature of machine consciousness.
 Or if that would be possible.
 Of my many failings, the most recent is a rejection from CIMC, the California
 Institute of Machine Consciousness.
 Whatever proposal I wrote to them (why, its in a neighboring directory,
 here!) was judged inadequate and insufficient of merit.
 What do I conclude? That I am an inadequate scholar? Perhaps.
 That I do not know how to play the social game, where they dole out the
 woofies, if not the actual cash? Well, that too.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was thinking the other day about the hustle for fame and cash, and the
 transient nature of information.
 Authors write books, publishers publish them, readers read them, authors
 get paid, they live another day and write another book, and a few hundred
 years later, this is all effectively forgotten.
 Whatever socio–political donor and money–flow goes on at the CIMC, it was
 too far away from me: I cannot provide the status that they seek.
 And does it matter? The activities will be forgotten in a hundred years,
 anyway.
 It's all temporary, transient, of the moment.
 The moment delivers winners and losers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The signaling of win and lose happens at all layers: when you lose with
 a girl, you don't have sex.
 When you lose a job, you don't have money.
 When you lose status, you lose your position in the social spotlight.
 The first two are definitely wired into low–level neural circuitry: rejection
 is definitely painful.
 And lack of status, a bit ..
 although there are clearly people who seek high social status, and they
 inflict pain on you (on me) when I don't meet their standards: they make
 it clear that I am not deserving of their attention.
 At any rate, rejection is painful, and as a human, I feel pain just like
 everyone else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so the topic here is then, in the context of AGI and machine intelligence,
 in the context of the platonic realm of mathematics, what is pain? What
 is rejection? What function does it serve, that it is so pervasive, widespread
 and fundamentally ingrained? Biologically so: clearly animals feel pain,
 and it would seem that, given the hormonal reaction of plants, that plants
 feel pain too, when they get eaten by bugs, and the like.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm feeling something like pain now.
 More properly, tiredness.
 Ongoing jet–lag.
 Woke at 5:30 after six hours sleep, now its almost two hours later, I've
 eaten breakfast, and accumulated some grunge in my neural synapses that
 the coffee is not clearing.
 Perhaps the pain of self–doubt, of the feeling that these words that I
 write are an inadequate expression of what I could be doing: the high–potential
 intellectual squandering my talents on the trite.
 The cleaning lady who can't hold a conversation.
 That kind of self–flagellation is exhausting.
 There are also humans who lack in self–doubt.
 Others who lack in empathy, And apparently, some who cannot feel physical
 pain.
 And other lacking in other ways.
 And yes, we can argue that they are flawed.
 Some are high–achievers.
 Some are nasty: we've got evil monsters running the Trump administration,
 and we could hope that hell awaits, but clearly, there is no biblical hell,
 so we are left with a crisis, and a lack of social mechanisms to correct
 for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, again, back to the topics of the socially acceptable, pain and feedback.
 Clearly, what the Trump admin does is not socially acceptable to mainstream
 norm Western society.
 They actively inflict damage, and create destruction.
 The feedback mechanisms meant to halt that destruction do not function.
 We are in collapse, in socio–economic collapse, in psychological collapse.
 Society is so rotten, so worm–eaten that mainstream Democrats and normies
 who should have stood up against Trump have turned into VIchy collaborators,
 Quizzlings, going along with the crime.
 Fuck the Democrats.
 And we kind of know what the socio–psychological causes that have led to
 this rot: a toxic stew of capitalism and journalism.
 I've stated my sand–pile theory before, I won't restate it: we have accumulated
 a collection of thought–patterns, structured by mainstream capitalism,
 and main–stream media, into mainstream Democratic thinking, that is rotten
 to it's core.
 There are no structural pillars to prevent the societal collapse brought
 on by the spread to the toxic Trump mind–virus through raw social–media
 sewage.
 I've murbled on all this before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But now I have something new to add to the formula: pain.
 When an organism feels pain, it can use that as a feedback mechanism to
 take corrective action.
 The conclusion I come to now is that the social organism of Western Civ
 is insufficiently sensitive to pain.
 Sure, we had the No Kings demonstrations, and millions showed up, But the
 crackpot Kennedy is still running anti–vaccine insanity.
 This is not immediately painful, as Joe Ordinary citizen hasn't been compelled
 to action that is any stronger than merely going to protests.
 The functional pillars of Congress, Congressional oversight, have been
 wrecked.
 Of judicial oversight.
 But can I really make the analogy of Congressional oversight to a pain–response
 signal? Clearly, regulatory mechanisms exist to take a machine that has
 traveled out of the bounds of acceptable behavior, and bring it back to
 within tolerance, and Wesern Civ has mostly built such a machine.
 And yet, as trump has shown: that machine is in decay.
 What, exactly, constitutes a pain signal, when there's fundamental structural
 damage? Yes the sirens are blaring: that's what the street protests are:
 blaring alarms.
 But the message is not getting through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so where am I at? Well, once again, I am faced with a complicated system
 doing complicated things, and I am trying to perform shallow reasoning
 on it, and this will get me where, exactly? And again, it feels like nowhere
 in particular.
 And so once again, perhaps writing this diary is about as useless as going
 to an anti–Trump street protest.
 Utterly ineffective.
 So what I need to do is to go back to sleep, un–jet–lag a bit more, and
 then pick up with writing actual code to do actual ...
 machine consciousness studies.
 Because ....
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because why? A deeply unstated religious belief that the situation is so
 dire, so wrecked, that the only way out is through machine consciousness.
 Moloch is torturing me.
 But its odd: its the good Moloch who tortures, saying

.
 This is, of course, the same as the Biblical Yaweh, who will happily burn
 you in hell if you are an evil person.
 The biblical Elohim who tortured young New England Protestants into becoming
 industrialists and creating capitalism as we know it.
 So Moloch tortures me now: create AGI to solve all world problems, or you

 What choice do I have? I am compelled.
 The river flows this way, I am carried on it's stream.
 What choice did Joan of Arc have? Whatever voices spoke in her head, she
 was compelled.
 We are all compelled, when we are not, and again this bridges back to my
 topic of free will, but free will is not the topic today.
 Sleep and jet lag is, and then some more coding.
 And maybe I will return here briefly to create a project plan.
 And, Oh, I have to do that email.
 Too many things, not enough time, and perhaps I am wasting my time doing
 things like ..

 dancing with words ..
 dancing with words in a socially inappropriate way, but no one will know,

\begin_layout Subsection*
19 June 2025 - Vision design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much later in the day.
 So I've got this general vision of exactly what to do, but then am stuck
 at the detailed design decisions, and perhaps by talking about it, I'll
 get forward progress.
 The meta–design is for the perception of structure.
 As a proof–of–concept, it will be for the the perception of structure in
 2D images.
 This forces a generalization of the earlier work on text, replacing the
 tokenization of text by a tokenization of images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, tokenization of images to be done by the vision wrapper, and there are
 two questions: first, what should the primitives be, and two, what is their
 meta–description? First was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what primitives in OpenCV?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The conventional math orientation is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

some orthogonal basis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, better might be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generators of some orthogonal basis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, better yet might be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wavelets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So I'm thinking: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

enlarge around a centroid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 – magnify, to zoom in on an image detail.
 Rotate about a point.
 Rotate and shear about a point.
 Rotate, shear, displace? Rotate would be one number, or an orthogonal 2x2
 matrix.
 But with shear, and with enlarge, and with displace, its a 2x3 homogenous
 matrix.
 The hard part is boundary tracking: input images are pixelated rectangles,
 due to technology.
 So, rather than actually magnifying, we're really selecting sub–rectangles,
 and so need to track those.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And rotation is a pair of shears.
 Should I track these separately, out of of pipe? i.e.
 instead of applying the transforms to each image, we just track the 2x3
 matrix mults, and do that only once at the end.
 I guess.
 Hmmm.
 That changes everything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then there's color–band selection.
 That's fairly clean, I guess, apply a transform to RGB or HSV or ...? Then
 texture selection.
 Will texture be needed for the ARC competition? Or are these all just simple
 2D rectangular graphics? What are the minimal primitives I need for that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then, what about detection? A final single–pixel yes/no answer? A single–pix
el sort–of answer?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
20 June 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, a lot of writing in front of me.
 Not this diary, but I do need to write a paper.
 But first, while sleeping, (what kind of sleep is this?) I realized that
 I could unite into one SetLink, SetValue and AtomSpace, and that perhaps
 I should.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's how I got there: I cannot use the pattern matcher as if it were a
 FilterLink, because I cannot limit it's search to a set; the pattern matcher
 must run on the entire AtomSpace.
 But what if I could build a mini–space, that only contained a small subset
 of atoms? Cause the current frame design assumes a super–set of everything
 below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I dunno.
 I can list the pros and cons, here.
 But I thought enough about this that I realized it is technically challenging,
 with a number of tricky issues to resolve.
 I mean I could do it, but also I do not have a burning need for this just
 yet.
 Why was I thinking of this as I tossed and turned in bed? I dunno.
 Perhaps I was reviewing the role of FilterLink.
 Well, more generally, the itchy feeling that really I need to have ability
 with lots of small subspaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mean, if I want to have a multi–agent system, they'll each want to sit
 in their own containers, but there's a common external world AtomSpace
 for them all, and the partitioning needs to be fast and simple and direct
 and easy.
 Gut sense says I really need this.
 Current software status has not yet elevated this to the top.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
21 June 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so I really don't have time for this, but still...
 maybe it's important.
 I just just started readng, in Lithuanian, Kestutis A.
 Trimakas Žmogaus Aukščiausi Skrydžiai, Religninių Išgyvenimu Psichologija
 ..
 to practice my Lithuanian language skills.
 Well, and of course, from the first few pages on, it is filled with the
 usual twaddle.
 And I don't think I would have recognized it as twaddle even a few years
 ago, so I need to perhaps set down and articulate my current best understanding
s.
 They are meant to be biological and physical in nature, are non–mainstream,
 will be flatly rejected by most readers of this text, and probably criticized
 as nihilistic by the rest.
 This is not true – there is something magical about the universe, but we're
 not there yet.
 But I digress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So my current model of human psychology really is based on the idea of the
 sandpile at self–organized criticality.
 That is, ideas, or perhaps statements, claims, realizations, understandings,
 quotes, institutionalized behaviors enter into the mind and accrete, or
 fall away, like grains of sand dropped on a pile.
 Every idea has sticky bits, and the sticky bits stick to other sticky bits
 that already make up the individual psyche.
 Some ideas do not have the right kind of sticky attachment points to adhere
 to some individuals psyche, and thus they slide away.
 The most common case is the non–notable event.
 Another case might be the lie – something that should be obviously rejected.
 The gullible are, of course, well, the sticky bits of the lie will stick,
 for them.
 And this notion of the individual psyche goes all the way up, from birth
 through socialization, education and adulthood: we are accretions of factoids,
 and nothing more (well, almost nothing more.
 More on that later.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And, like sand–piles, there are avalanches.
 Some of those avalanches we call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ah–ha
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 moments.
 Other avalanches, big ones, are termed nervous breakdowns.
 So back to that book: it talks of the transcendental experience.
 So I'm thinking that the transcendental experience is much like the nervous
 breakdown, but of a more pleasurable form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Argh.
 Why am I writing this drivel? I believe what I wrote above, but it is shsallow,
 and I am not all that interested in pushing it farther.
 A half–assed job might be enough.
 The meta–setting for this is AGI, in that the human emotional and psychological
 landscape is a landscape that any other embodiment of life will have to
 have, and so I am interested in pinning down its basic outline sufficiently
 well, that I can work with it in the context of AGI.
 But I am an old man, now, and my time is limited: the decades slip by,
 and I don't have forever to create and articulate some over–arching theory
 of psychology.
 So, this is all necessarily shallow and provisional.
 Fuck, I need to repair the kitchen sink, that's what I really need to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, that book also talks of the tribulations of the soul.
 My general ipressoion of most humans is that they live in a barely suppressed
 mode of crisis.
 Life is somehow some mad scramble, but a failing scramble for fulfillment,
 satisfaction, accomplishment, well, and of course the baser Maslow desires
 covered later in the book, but when I talk to people, its always in the
 back of my mind: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why are you like that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why are you doing that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and its always that they are in a living crisis, Firesign Theatre: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's a seeker born every minute.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Blah blah blah, I am boring myself.
 Obviously, as complex organisms I am not going to boil down human psychology
 to a few paragraphs, but I do like the idea that everyone is living in
 a mode of crisis, and that this explains why there is so much fucked up
 behavior.
 I also like the idea of avalanches as accounting for the assorted shifts
 that people undergo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, moving on, while tossing and turning in bed, I had a few more thoughts.
 First was the question of bringing into accord the idea of energy minimization
 with this psychological landscape, and before any progress is made on that
 front, I have a crisis about energy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So consider the atom, say, the hydrogen atom, in the excited state.
 It emits a photon and decays into a lower–energy state.
 But why? Well, we also know that energy is conserved, so why would an atom
 emit a photon? So then I think back above to my musings about wave–function
 collapse, and the tanks into which vibrational modes spread, and I guess
 that the answer has to be, when considering the excited atom, plus the
 photon field, plus the tank of states at the other end of the photon (the
 absorbers) when one diagonalizes that entire collection, one discovers
 that the excited hydrogen atom is really a superposition of states, of
 vibrational modes, such that most of those modes are in the tank, and that
 as one charts the time evolution, the superposition that defines the excited
 atom is overwhelmed by the millions and billions of modes into which it
 evolves.
 So the principle here is not energy minimization: energy is conserved.
 And it's not exactly entropy maximization: the vast volume of the tanks
 does not change.
 But its not ergodic, either, the normal modes remain normal, and they don't
 mix.
 It's just that a billion normal modes temporarily coincide into the form
 of an excited hydrogen atom, and then they continue to evolve, onwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And I still don't have mixing.
 And I still have the problem of Wigner's friend.
 And, in my sleep, I wanted to somehow attach the biomolecular evolutionary
 dynamics of human psychology back onto some physical notion of ..
 well, it can't be energy minimization, and it can't be entropy maximization,
 and I probably rolled over and fell asleep then.
 Fuck, I'm feeling sleepy as I write this.
 Some neurotransmitter or another accumulates in my synapses as I write
 this, and it is not cleared away sufficiently rapidly, and it makes me
 sleepy.
 Coffee is not enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And anyway, I'm bored, because these are shallow insights, and I have some
 important things to do today, so toodle-oo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
22 June 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, lets get back in the game.
 I've been procrastinating, because the problem is actually hard.
 But then it seems well within grasp so I relax and procrastinate some more,
 and bingo: lack of progress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The image issue is a segmentation issue.
 One way to do this is to fall back on stereotypical ideas of vision: what's
 the largest extent of a region with a color or texture? Where are there
 large color gradient changes? But this is engineering, and I don't want
 to do engineering.
 Another thought is to create chains of DSP filters, or perhaps trees, when
 that is appropriate, that reduce images to a single floating–point signal.
 There can also be another tree: one that combines these single–float signals
 arithmetically, algebraically.
 Even neural–netishly: if I have a vector of filters, each generating a
 float, then that vector can be manipulated, can be run though summers and
 sigmoids and what not.
 But I don't want to do training, I don't want to do gradient descent.
 I want to perform some sort of MI correlational observations on the outputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what sort of MI should I look for? High–MI? So, high–MI works for language
 where I know that I've already tokenized into meaningful tokens.
 And I am not computing the MI of the word against itself.
 But with some random image processing filter, I risk having two 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

different
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 filters that just happen to feature–detect exactly the same feature,so
 of course, they will always be correlated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crap.
 I'm being interrupted, just as I'm ready to argh ...
 I've thought through this before, and gone farther, but those thoughts
 are scattered.
 I have to unscatter.
 After I skeedaddle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Four hours later
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm hung over.
 Linas Cicenas took me to lunch and feed me too much food and now I'm stuffed
 and tired, and sleepy even and I should take a nap but I'm drinking coffee.
 Crap.
 Definitely not at 100%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So one solution to the above is to ask that the filters distribute uniformly
 over some space, e.g.
 a high–dimensional sphere.
 But it's not clear how to encode the trees into sphere coordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A related idea that I want to mash into all this is the critical sandpile.
 So the perception trees need to be organized into little jigsaws ...
 well, we have that already, and a valid tree is a tree that is a syntactically
 valid assemblage of pieces, so what am I worried about? Well, I don't see
 where the avalanches are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One possible encoding is just to write each tree as a string s–expression
 and then do a conventional embedding of this string into a fixed N–dimensional
 space.
 e.g.
 a boolean encoding.
 This is vaguely unsatisfactory as it requires fixing N.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But also this is not a functional encoding.
 It encodes the syntactic structure of the tree, but not what it does functional
ly, and the point is that trees with huge syntactic differences can process
 data in nearly in a nearly identical fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is also distinct from the external stimulus.
 Its the distribution of external stimuli, together with how we process
 them that we want to distribute in a uniform way.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Look at XZ–calculus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adam is explaining to me his idea of an action language.
 There are several levels; the lower level is interesting to me.
 At the low level, I have a tree, an abstract syntax tree, and a set of
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

actions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

messages
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that perform edits to the tree, at the current cursor location.
 The edits are always inserts, I guess they could be deletes, too.
 The base level is some hand–crafted primitives that do these edits.
 Starting with the empty string, a stream of these edits creates a tree.
 Cool!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But then, his trees are always programming–language specific, and the actions
 are auto–generated for that language.
 These actions are available to the human (the original intent was that
 humans would be performing these edits) but now we are talking about having
 a transformer generate these edit streams.
 But still, all of this happens to human–usable programming language, and
 not to my Atomese.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, different Atomese Link types are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

different
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and so conceivably could be constructed with different edit streams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I don't know if this makes sense to you, but it makes sense to me as I type
 this.
 To recap again, there's an edit stream.
 That edit stream creates trees, moving around a cursor as it does so.
 i.e.
 it is a non–linear editor, of sorts.
 i.e.
 instead of inserting left to right, it inserts at the syntactically appropriate
 location at just that moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I want to call it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

non–linear editing
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he calls it

semantic typing

 He says he developed this idea eight years ago.

\begin_layout Standard
Old unresolved problem in automated theorem provers: shortly after the developme
nt of that technology (1980's??) there were two crisis that occurred in
 rapid succession.
 First, there was the (short–lived) belief that theorem provers would put
 mathematicians out of a job, as they would automatically generate all possible
 mathematics, and there would be nothing left to do, but to casually peruse
 the results.
 Upon the examination of the first few results, it was realized that the
 generated theorems were true but boring, providing no particular insight,
 and being of little human interest.
 This should have provoked the second crisis: what is it that mathematicians
 do that is of human interest, and why is that interesting, and not something
 else?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I don't have an answer to this question, and I have not tripped over anything
 compelling that answered it.
 I can hazard a few guesses, but they are trite and unsatisfying.
 What is interesting to humans, in general? Well, that is framed by upbringing,
 schooling, culture, peer–groups, parents, genetics, society.
 What is interesting to universities looking to hire young professors is
 not just the line of research that the young person is engaged in, but
 the interests of the tenured chairs and the professors on the selection
 committee.
 Yes, sometimes someone is hired out of sheer brilliance, but more often,
 politics and popularity contests prevail: whatever has been preoccupying
 the mathematical community this year, this decade, whatever is popular,
 whatever has appeared at the cusp as a breakthrough exposing a new seam
 to mine, that is what is considered to be important and of interest.
 And that, in turn, is shaped by what the professors, what the community
 learned when they were young students: the preoccupations of youth bleed
 into adulthood, and the preoccupations of youth are shaped by culture and
 society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So this is a tangled feedback mechanism, stretching through centuries of
 cultural thought, shaping modern preoccupations.
 In a sense, this is obvious, what else could it be? The above paragraph
 is no deeper than what might be found in some introductory textbook on
 sociology.
 Great.
 And theorem provers, not being human, being purely mechanical apparatuses,
 cannot know what is interesting to the current generation of living humans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By using LLM's, this could be corrected.
 An LLM trained on all published mathematics would 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

know
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, would encode what it is that humans have thought about so far, and could
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intuit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 what might be interesting to humans, in the short–term future.
 So a stupid computer trick would be to hook up a theorem prover to an LLM,
 have it generate theorems, and then have the LLM filter them, selecting
 out those that it thinks humans might find to be important.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This premonition flashed through my head, that my diary here will belong
 to the collection of Memoirs Found in a Bathtub.
 I mean, the human race might self–destruct, wipe out civilization, and
 that is the true solution to the Fermi Paradox: civilizations do not survive
 the singularity.
 But whatever, I distract myself with off–topic posts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the above analysis implies that human things are the things that humans
 do, and this is a product of deep and wide socio–cultural and genetic evolution.
 Synthetic algorithms perform in ways utterly unlike human thought, and
 insofar as we might be able to create an intelligent machine, it will be
 utterly unlike us, utterly alien.
 And so it will be, and there's not much we can do to change that.
 It is a different domain.
 This should not be surprising; there are a zillion examples from biology
 of things that are not like us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what's the problem? Well, multiple.
 Wire–heading as an example of the desire to plug into something greater,
 better, larger, an almost eschatological end for the true believer, vs.
 say, the Amish, rejecting the foreignness of modernity.
 We are friendly with the Amish: they are a cultural curiosity.
 This is not the case for some of the virulent right–wing belief systems
 that are openly hostile to mainstream beliefs.
 This is not limited to the so–called

 for Xi-though.
