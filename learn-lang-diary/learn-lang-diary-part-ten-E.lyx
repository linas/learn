\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-E
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
June 2025 – present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language–learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten–D, which got
 over–long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am making the assumption that
 no human being will ever actually read this.
 Thus, it is filled with random stuff I feel like writing.
 Some of it is very personal, some of it is nonsense.
 Mostly, I am finding that the act of writing helps otherwise vague and
 scattered thoughts quantum–collapse into a more coherent form, where I
 can examine them, like a dead butterfly pinned down in a display case.
 Dead words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
If you are interested in this content, then you should ask an AI agent to
 read it, then pretended that it's me, then ask about it.
 I believe that present–day LLM technology is sufficiently advanced to be
 able to do this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Ten already got an introduction.
 A different way of thinking is about what is going on here is that this
 is a form of life–logging.
 Or, in 18th century terms, a diary.
 Just not anywhere near as compelling as those written by the famous diarists.
 This one is more of a mental self–portrait.
 And not even for you but for myself.
 Not to cast a narcissistic gaze at my own words, but to organize my own
 thoughts.
 Still in the experimental stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
4 June 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once more into the breach.
 So I really should write up here–and–now formally, because I think I have
 good results that are worth stating publicly.
 I am, however, stuck with thermalization.
 This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs.
 I've been fumbling with some ideas, but they break apart before I get very
 far.
 I think I wrote a to–do list task before, but let me try again:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Given some graph, what can be said about the (eigenvalue) spectrum of that
 graph? Presumably, the set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all graphs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be divided into distinct regions, with first and second–order phase
 transitions between these regions.
 What kind of a research program has the power to create this map? I can
 certainly start by doing some experimental work, I guess, but this is a
 major project.
 Explore a collection of small graphs.
 Some regular graphs e.g.
 grids.
 Random graphs with various typical statistical properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do the wave–vector work.
 Where I last left this was that there should be wave–vectors associated
 with graph automorphisms.
 Some automorphism groups will be abelian – e.g.
 those for conventional solid–state physics on crystalline lattices.
 Others will be non–abelian, I have no clue what those are, and making progress
 seems to require brute force work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The graph approach to thermalization then suggests that the 3D structure
 of space might be emergent.
 That the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

actual
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 quantum world may live on some graph or hypergraph structure (we can vectorize
 hypergraphs into graphs, thanks to tensoring.) And the 3D structure of space
 may in fact be some phase–transition boundary, some critical point, where
 graphs on one side fail to have a spectrum that gives thermalization, and
 graphs on the other side do.
 This makes space emergent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What about spacetime? Is space–time emergent? The core graph model still
 has a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 that appears as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{n}\tau}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}$
\end_inset

 one of the eigenvalues, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 looks a lot like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, the Renninger setup emphasizes that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 will map to many distinct and different values of lab–frame proper time,
 so that different space–time regions in different parts of the lab, correspond
 to the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, but just in different parts of the graph.
 So if my graph is 
\begin_inset Formula $G=G_{L}\otimes B\otimes G_{R}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 the narrow bridge, and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 the large thermal tanks, then states on 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 evolved as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{n}\tau}$
\end_inset

 even though 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to one side of the lab, in the lab–frame–proper–time past of
 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 is another spatial region, in the lab–frame–proper–time future of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

.
 So, in this sense, time is also emergent, but it seems that also lab–frame
 proper–time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 maps to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 linearly.
 Well, more strongly: well, denote 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}$
\end_inset

 as the lab–frame proper time in 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and likewise for 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}$
\end_inset

 and thus I hypothesize that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}-t_{L}=\mbox{const.}>0$
\end_inset

 so that proper time runs at constant speed in both halves, because they
 are stationary with respect to one–another.
 i.e.
 no relativistic time dilation.
 And more: that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}-\tau=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}-\tau=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 really is the proper time in the rest frame, even though in some parts
 of the lab, it's in the future, and some parts of the lab, its in the past.
 This is for the Renninger setup, where the detectors are strictly time–like
 ordered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For the Clauser–Aspect–Zeilinger type setup, where the left and right sides
 of the lab are space–like separated when the measurements are made, then
 it is not legal to talk about 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}-t_{L}$
\end_inset

 because if the issue of selecting a space–like surface on which to define
 these two.
 However, we must still have that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}-\tau=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}-\tau=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 and, in a certain sense, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}=t_{R}$
\end_inset

 because these space–like separated regions are both happening at the same
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 That is, both 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 are happening at the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, even though they are space–like separated from one–another.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the here–and–now parameter.
 It does not (cannot) specify a space–like surface, because for the Renninger
 setup, it becomes time–like, even though 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is still the same here–and–now parameter.
 So, in this sense, space–time is emergent from the graph, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 can be recognized as advancing at speed one in the lab rest frame, and
 thus identifiable as proper time, even though it cannot be used to order
 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

, because both 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 are at the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, irrespective of whether 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 are space–like or time–like separated in the lab.
 I think this all makes sense, but clearly I am struggling with algebraic
 formalities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How it is that the Minkowski structure of space–time emerges from the 
\begin_inset Formula $G=G_{L}\otimes B\otimes G_{R}$
\end_inset

 structure is entirely unclear.
 Perhaps there have to be many bridges 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 connecting many sub–graphs.
 So this then becomes a question: what's the tensor algebra decomposition
 if we have some regions like 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 that are densely connected, and a bunch of thin bridges connecting these
 dense parts? Under what circumstances with a 3+1 decomposition arise for
 such graphs? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I kick back here, and here's the train of thought.
 I would like to ask an LLM how to thermalize, but they are too stupid to
 answer that question.
 Because the LLM's don't understand graph theory, algebra, tensors, none
 of that.
 Nor can they run experiments on matrices.
 I can't ask the LLM to compute the eigenvalues of things, and then to fiddle
 the algebra for me, and do it again.
 Search for phase transitions on large graphs.
 I want to automate my science experiment.
 But how?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I would like to build an algebra explorer.
 Now, mathematicians have developed plenty of theorem–proving tools.
 I think I know how those go, I don't yet see how to leverage them.
 Should I build an algebra system founded on Atomese, as the substrate?
 Yes, I probably should.
 Should I combine it with the current ideas about agency and evidence? Yes,
 I should.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did have a chance to recap the story of MOSES for someone, yesterday,
 and recapping that, I got to review the issues associated with recursive
 self–improvement that were hit by MOSES.
 There are many issues.
 One serious issue was the use of an objective function which was to be
 optimized.
 This is doomed, it's a paperclip–maximizer.
 The accretion–agglomeration concept of perception and agency is the only
 plausible replacement that I have for that.
 One of the issues was that, when looking at MOSES as an explorer of a search
 space, that search space grows combinatorially with the program complexity.
 It explodes, out of control, and the learning curves plateau out, because
 the terrain becomes locally very flat, there's no gradient to climb.
 This is something we already know from natural selection: the solution
 space looks like a golf–course: a large expanse of nearly flat territory:
 noise, mostly, disturbing the flatness.
 And after a long and difficult search, you find the hole.
 Sink the golf–ball, and now you emerge on a new terrain, that is much much
 bigger than before.
 Ugh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The accretion–agglomeration model avoids this.
 Instead, you are sticking parts onto other parts, and yes, of course, there
 are ever–more possibilities, but who cares? Stick them together, and see
 if the result is functional...
 what does it mean to be functional? Well, maybe this is the other road–block.
 If you have an agent in an environment, all it can do is go out there and
 play.
 It plays, it learns a few things.
 Gets more sophisticated at playing ...
 and then what? Ugh.
 The universe it inhabits is a dream–world, it wanders through this universe,
 exhibiting curiosity and playfulness, but mostly hallucinating what it
 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

out there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the universe, as opposed to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in here
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inside the agent.
 But perhaps I am personifying too much.
 The agent is more like that critical sandpile, accreting new experiences
 and information, sloughing off in avalanches, both of the universe and
 in the universe, with a boundary between the two that is both clear–cut
 and also ambiguous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever.
 This is a nice model of agency.
 Should I build it? Just earlier, I wanted an algebraic system.
 So I guess what I really want is an agent that can wander through the space
 of algebra.
 How can I build that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I want 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

like an LLM, but for algebra
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but I don't want an LLM literally, because I don't want to train it on
 algebra, I want it to discover algebra.
 So, in some sense, an axiom–explorer.
 Generate a collection of axioms, treat these as jigsaw pieces, then randomly
 assemble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So lets try this with the axioms of set theory? Step one: how do I encode
 the axioms of set theory as jigsaws? Step two: how do I generate novel
 combinations? Perhaps the universe of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

out there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 needs to be the collection of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all possible jigsaws
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (aka 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all possible axioms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and the agent is an explorer that attempts to grab these, and assemble
 them.
 What does it mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

to assemble
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Well, conventionally, these are proofs – collisions of axioms that can
 be assembled, and then eventually terminate.
 For conventional mathematics, they terminate in true/false.
 I suppose true and false can be considered to be jigsaws themselves.
 A characteristic of proofs is that they start with small theorems, blow
 up large in the middle of the proof, and then terminate.
 I suspect what I really want is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reverse mathematics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, start with nothing, let the thing blow up, and then wait for it to become
 small again: to reduce.
 The result off the reduction is now the theorem.
 The theorem can now be added to the collection of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

known things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The collection of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

known things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are then used during generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, generation can be viewed as a kind of exploration.
 What is the difference, really, between MOSES–style genetic generation,
 and, say exhaustive generation, such as odometers (Markov odometers, etc.)
 and just, I dunno ...
 random accretion...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is the dictionary of accumulated knowledge, well, nominally, it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

internal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the agent, but to the generator, it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

external
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: it is a place where the agent can get things, and put things (i.e.
 get things that represent axioms and theorems, and put new theorems when
 they are discovered.
 So, its memory.
 It's memory exclusive to the agent, i.e.
 incorruptible by other agents working in the external world.
 In a multi–agent system, one will want to have a common, shared memory,
 when multiple agents can contribute new discoveries.
 Unlike the private memory, this risks 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

corruption
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or unexpected changes.
 Of course, the external memory is a communications channel between agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wonder if I should use the pi–calculus as the API to memory.
 it is certainly a minimal model for a multi–agent communications system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then my thoughts zoom off again.
 The pi–calculus can also be used as..
 well, suppose we have communication over links, on graphs ...
 Can I look at pi–calculus as some fragment of linear logic?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which runs me back into a circle: the classical world is a Cartesian category,
 the quantum world is the dagger–symmetric category; these are known fragments,
 that is, monoidal categories with some additional axioms.
 Which I could try to work out by hand, being careful to articulate what's
 the same, what's different.
 Perhaps these axioms assemble in a way that resemble Ext and Tor.
 There are just such a large variety of analogies that can be made, that
 can be imagined, some of which are maybe widely useful, some maybe dead–ends,
 and it is very tempting to be the olde–school mathematician and tackle
 these with pencil and paper, when in fact I recognize an axiomatic system
 that should be explored using a generative apparatus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So maybe I should just say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fuck it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and start writing code to implement the vision above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before I do that, how much time should I sped trying to imagine a structural
 encoding in terms of binary strings?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I want to bootstrap this, and get to self–modifying ASAP.
 How? Is pi–calculus a place to start?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is that premature?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should I experiment with a specific task? Should I create a system that
 can do eigenvector solving on a graph, and let it then explore algebraic
 variants, and thereby maybe discover number fields or something like that?
 Of course, if it does do this, how do I attach this back to the English
 language? I need to talk to it.
 If it discovers a well–known mathematical concept, I certainly do NOT want
 to try to read through the axioms and figure out what it was.
 So I also need the evidence–solver, to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

these two things are probably the same.
 Except, for pure math, I need to have it work 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

absolutely, certainly the same
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and not fuzzy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...
 and so I need the unifier.
 Unification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crap.
 Where to start.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I need a connector–upper.
 Except the existing query engine can do that.
 Except it has a complicated syntax.
 So its like re–inventing lisp: step one: what is the most minimal system?
 Step two? How can I create a description of the minimal system, so that
 reasoning can be performed on it? That is, how do I create a minimal system
 that is self–describing? I have lots of parts I can use; how do I ...
 ??? Step four: Profit!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I need to reinvent the URE, but doing it correctly, this time ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I want to have a gas of rules, with some ..
 Boltzmann distribution, and then have it do self–chemistry, evolutionary
 chemistry on itself.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

memory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the collection of molecules that get discovered.
 But what of the combinatoric explosion?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somehow, RNN's got past the combinatoric explosion.
 How? Well, for starters, RNN's are trained; there's an objective function,
 they're trying to minimize it.
 But I don't have an objective function; I just have an agent that wants
 to try all possibilities.
 How can I get agents to team up? I can imagine each node in an RNN diagram,
 the attention heads, whatever, as an individual agent, and each one tried
 to hook up somehow with the other agents, accepting inputs and delivering
 outputs...
 who hooks these up? How is the data pumped? Whence does the data come from?
 I've got pipes carrying data.
 The recursive step is to have pipes carrying pipes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RNN used a vector encoding.
 Symbols were sprayed onto an n–dimensional sphere, uniformly.
 Then symbol sequences ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
6 June 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thought about the wave vectors in the middle of the night, while tossing
 and turning.
 It's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not that hard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, even if the symmetry group of the graph is non–abelian.
 Keywords are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal subgroup
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

group center
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So, for example, imagine the group has as a subgroup the cyclic group 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Corresponding to this will be a collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 eigenfunctions, having the form 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\pi km/n}$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th atom in the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th harmonic.
 Just basic standing–wave harmonics on a necklace with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 beads.
 The energy (eigenvalue) of each mode will be 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{k}$
\end_inset

 with higher 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 being higher energy: these will not be degenerate eigenmodes.
 However, the eigenmodes will be degenerate, in general, depending on the
 divisibility of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 So, for example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is divisible by four, and we consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $k=4$
\end_inset

'th harmonic, there will be 
\begin_inset Formula $n/4$
\end_inset

 distinct eigenmodes, offset by a phase factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $1,e^{i\pi k/n},e^{i\pi2k/n},\cdots$
\end_inset

 obtained by rotating the ring, i.e.
 by restarting the numbering of the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th atom by 
\begin_inset Formula $0,1,2,\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 These are orthogonal.
 All of them are degenerate, having the same energy.
 The generator of the cyclic group 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 can be envisioned as a displacement: it just rotates the necklace by one
 step.
 This generator just carries the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|k,p\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 eigenfunction to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|k,p+1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 eigenfunction, for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le p<n/k$
\end_inset

.
 Instead of using words, I guess I should use formulas: the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th atom has 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle m\vert k,p\right\rangle =e^{i\pi k\left(m+p\right)/n}=e^{i\pi km/n}e^{i\pi kp/n}=e^{i\pi kp/n}\left\langle m\vert k,0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever.
 The point is that for each cyclic subgroup of the symmetry group, there's
 an associated subset of the eigenvectors that are characterized by a collection
 of orthogonal modes of this conventional standing–wave form, that are character
ized by a momentum wave–vector that is some integral multiple of the length
 of that cyclic subgroup.
 There's also the energy, the eigenvalue for each mode.
 What is not clear is the dispersion relation that connects the two.
 Is it linear? Does it have the form of a quadratic polynomial, i.e.
 having the form 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{2}=a_{1}p_{1}^{2}+a_{2}p_{2}^{2}+\cdots+m^{2}$
\end_inset

 for constants 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},a_{2,}\cdots,m^{2}$
\end_inset

? Or is it some polynomial with higher order terms? I guess it could be
 something else entirely...
 although a characterization in terms of the cyclic subgroups remains key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For large random graphs with 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{23}$
\end_inset

 vertices in them, what is the distribution of the graph automorphism groups?
 What does it mean to have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a random graph
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Getting the automorphism group is hard.
 What about the homology groups of the graph? How are they distributed?
 Is there a relation between the homology groups, and the automorphism group?
 For every homology group of higher order, I can imagine a collection of
 harmonics on that group.
 How do those harmonics tie into the spectrum? I don't recall seeing anything
 that touches on such questions.
 I guess I should ask some LLM to see if it knows anything about stuff like
 this.
 Which is more work, more reading.
 The other possibility is to just make an exhaustive list of small graphs,
 and see if a pattern emerges...
 when? When will I have time to do this?

I want to revist certain portions of as–moses.

LTN Logic Tensor Networks has a DL/NN structure.

\begin_layout Standard
While I search for that tab to refresh my memory, I glance at the model–context–
protocol page, and am reminded that I need an MCP for the atomspace, to
 talk about what is in there.
 A demo tutorial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LTN is here: https://github.com/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks It
 is actually kind–of useless.
 It embeds atomic constants as vectors, predicates as matrices or tensors,
 and atomic formulas as graphs.
 Logic connectives use fuzzy semantics, quantifiers are aggregates, the
 whole mess is converted to tensorflow graphs.
 See the README there for more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is this useless? Well, because the list of logic connectives is hard–coded
 – and, or, not, implies.
 The variables are hard–coded as lists of possible individuals, quantifiers
 are hard–coded as mean.
 And the whole thing is pushed into tensorflow.
 which is maybe the only interesting thing, since it provides a mapping
 of predicate logic into a funky fuzzy NN logic.
 Which is ...
 interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, lets compare to PLN.
 The idea of PLN was to do forward chaining, backward chaining, etc.
 to find logical inferences, given a collection of inference rules given
 in the PLN book.
 So the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to do would be to ..
 well create an automatic chainer, and then convert the chain into LTN–style
 tensorflow networks.
 Except that, of course, we want to use MOSES–style tree decorations instead
 of chainers.
 And we want to use not MOSES decorators, but a generic jigsaw random assembly
 system.
 And I have been stuck at exactly this point for years.
 Some kind of ...
 mental block, I know what I want I seem unable to get it.
 Cue Sex Pistols for the refrain.
 The jigsaws are ...
 link–grammar disjuncts.
 I tried ten years ago with the Viterbi parser, which ran out of CPU and
 was slow.
 The LG parser is fast.
 So ...
 what's the problem?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where do I begin? I have a cascade ot tasks here.
 I need to organize them into priority.

 I'm tired, now.

\begin_layout Subsection*

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, the above got me so excited, I could not fall asleep.
 I fought the urge to get up and work on it all night.
 I could not find the usual mindset that would nock me out, sleeping.
 Perhaps I drank too much coffee the day before, but I doubt it.
 I also resumed taking magnesium threonate, the second time after a month
 not taking it, and maybe that kept me awake.
 I've noticed that hard thinking makes me sleepy, so I thought I'd work
 on a boring math problem in my head, till that knocked me out.
 Took a while, but it did.
 And thus, first thing this morning, instead of working on the above, I
 has some minor math results to report.
 Crap.
 Here goes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the math problem is to find the eigenvalues of the fully connected graph.
 The clique graph.
 The Hamiltonian for oscillators that interact via graph edges.
 This has the Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 with 1 on the diagonal and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 for all off–diagonal entries.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{ij}=\delta_{ij}+\epsilon\left(1-\delta_{ij}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 For small 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

, the rows and columns are already almost orthonormal.
 Geometrically, the rows and columns form an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

–cube, a bit sheared and compressed along the diagonal 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{0}=\left[1,1,\cdots,1\right]=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}e_{k}$
\end_inset

, and completely rotationally symmetric about this axis.
 The eigenvalue is 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{0}=1+\left(n-1\right)\epsilon$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $Hv_{0}=E_{0}v_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The remaining eigenvectors are all degenerate, and have the energy 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}=1-\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 The rotational symmetry gives a large choice for picking the eigenvectors.
 It will be convenient to set 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}=e_{0}-e_{k}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in\left\{ 1,\cdots,n-1\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 This gives 
\begin_inset Formula $Hv_{k}=E_{1}v_{k}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

 are not orthonormal.
 Although 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{0}\cdot v_{k}=n\delta_{k0}$
\end_inset

 we do have 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}\cdot v_{j}=1$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j>0$
\end_inset

.
 I didn't notice this while sleeping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, we want to entangle 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{0}$
\end_inset

 with a Renninger photon, or a Clauser–Aspect–Zeilinger doublet.
 For now, lets just hit it with a hammer.
 That is, decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{0}$
\end_inset

 into a superposition.
 For this, note that 
\begin_inset Formula $ne_{0}=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}v_{k}$
\end_inset

, and so by normalizing appropriately, we find that hitting 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{0}$
\end_inset

 with a hammer excites all the modes.
 They're not normal modes, because I screwed up and did not orthogonalize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, what was interesting was asking the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how long before recurrence?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 given that each state evolves as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{1}t}$
\end_inset

 and the diagonal as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{0}t}$
\end_inset

? Well, for my non–orthonormal basis, the answer is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

really fast.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 And so for the Renninger setup, if one tank is a clique of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 oscillators and the other is of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 oscillators, connected by a single edge, then the wave function 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

collapses
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into one tank, then 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

uncollapses
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and goes into the other tank, resonating at some ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $m/n$
\end_inset

.
 And of course, this is what we expect, given that the system is in a whole
 completely linear; there's no non–linear dissipative term, and we're dealing
 with the problem of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wigner's friend
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 But I knew that coming in, the goal was to ...
 I dunno.
 Think about this till I fell asleep.
 And so there we are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other thoughts were abut what if 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is small but random for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\ne j$
\end_inset

, and what if 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is tri–diagonal (a linear chain, but we know that already) and I look at
 the edges as defining 1-simplexes, and triangles as 2-simplexes, then what
 if the graph is constructed to have 3-simplexes only? i.e.
 a cell complex of dimension 3, a piece–wise tessellation of a 3-manifold?
 I don't know the answers.
 But again, since we're always dealing with a linear system, its always
 Wigner's friend.
 Nothing is evaded here.
 Still, interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coda: The issue is that points 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{k}t}\left|k\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 always live on an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

–torus, and at best those orbits become dense on the torus if the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{k}$
\end_inset

 are pair–wise irrational.
 Which makes them barely ergodic, and certainly not mixing.
 If we hope to do better, we need some deformation of that torus.
 Or perhaps abandon the lab–frame Newtonian pseudo–time, so different paths
 can arrive at the same point with different times.
 The obvious candidates, special and general relativity are covariant.
 If curvature can be used to generate mixing, its far beyond the intellectual
 apparatus I've set up so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, time to get back to coding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
13 June 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Been using Claude Code for the last week or so, and I have to say that it
 is actually pretty good with what it does ..
 at least, if you have it set up with the correct prompt.
 My first round of attempts with using plain–old web–based Claude, and it
 made a total hash of things, I spent all day trying to create a functional
 pyproject.toml for the AtomSpace, and it kept generating broken crap, and
 then apologizing every time.
 It would have been faster for me to just read the docs, and do it myself.
 Which is slow, tedious and painful, because I'm human and my rate of thinking
 is very limited.
 ...
 However ...
 with the right prompts...
 Levi has a Claude.md that has very explicit instructions about doing everything,
 not taking short–cuts, reading the docs in full, double–checking, writing
 unit tests, making sure the unit tests pass, etc etc.
 32KB of explicit instructions, 1K lines, and when Claude reads that, then
 the code that it generates seems to be of high quality.
 So far.
 I still have very limited experience, having created maybe a dozen files,
 half in python, half in C++, but it seems to be good stuff.
 I am keeping a careful eye over it.
 The fiddly bits I am doing myself, this was for the cogserver.
 Claude wrote the boilerplate, but I manually plugged it into place.
 I doubt it would have been able to plug it in correctly; I figured it would
 take too much time to explain how I want it done, so I did that part myself.
 But still, for the limited tasks so far, I'm impressed.
 It seems to be a useful coding tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I'm using it to create an MCP server for the cogserver that will be able
 to access the AtomSpace.
 So this is kind–of useless, but its a proof–of–concept, to show that ...
 MCP can be used to talk to the atomspace.
 Creating individual atoms by talking to claude would be pointlessly inefficient
, but perhaps ...
 I dunno, maybe I'll be able to teach claude how to create complex structures.
 Maybe.
 That was not the original intent, this just popped in my head as I was
 writing this.
 The original intent was to move forward on the ideas re moses+ltn+lg ideas
 from the 10 June entry above.
 That will require a lot of heavy lifting and design, but maybe with Claude,
 I'll be able to get it done...
 Clearly, no one else is going to help me with this, Ben is utterly disintereste
d, none of the coders in that sphere are intellectually capable of advancing
 this.
 But Claude is compliant and patient.
 Maybe not exactly smart, but it seems like it will be able to create usable
 systems much faster than I could if I typed by hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Last night, I realized that my mode of work tends to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in the flow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I don't think much, I just flow.
 So, when designing new systems, I spend ten minutes or half an hour or
 whatever, decide how to do something, and then spend hours or all day doing
 it, just coding.
 And coding is just mindless work – just surfing, not thinking.
 Its both fun and unrewarding – it feels like doing cross–word puzzles.
 You solve the puzzle, but have little to show for it, other than some working
 code, and it took all day to do it.
 Claude upends this.
 Claude does the coding grunt–work.
 I will now have to think at a higher abstraction level? Perhaps working
 at that level will again turn back into flow, where I mostly just fiddle
 trying to get Claude to do the right thing.
 But still, it seems like I will be able to design more sophisticated systems
 more quickly.
 Well see.
 Hang on, I have to break and see what Claude has done.
 Be right back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yeah, no.
 Claude does good work, but is slow–going.
 Error prone, gets confused, breaks stuff.
 Resulting code is not optimal and quite ugly at times.
 Alas.

\begin_layout Standard
While sleeping, I worked on the orthogonal clique eigenvector problem.
 Obvious ideas like sines and cosines don't work.
 What I eventually settled on was a Walsh or Hadamard style basis vectors.
 For N=5, these are (1,-1,0,0,0) and (0,0,1,-1,0) and (1,1,-1,-1,0) and
 (1,1,1,1,-4) with obvious generalizations for all N.
 Acceptable for even N, the odd N case makes me wonder if there is a more
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

symmetric
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 variant.
 I'm glimpsing how to construct that now, but I've ran out of time and have
 more important things to do right now.
 Still, a mildly curious teaser.

 It's like time stopped.

\begin_layout Standard
Rave museum? WTF? So there's a stage ad an audience, and that's one of the
 main topics of debate: is the documentation of raves in Lithuania, 1992–2004
 a museum–worthy topic? And of course, the answer is yes, as otherwise I
 would not be here.
 So, for me, this is again the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is it, that is worth doing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and bless the Lithuanians, they seem to arrive at the right answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I guess you could do this in American culture, but there, anything
 goes, so you can do anything, and nothing is surprising.
 Here, the boundaries are more distinct.
 So last nights meditation was on behavioral boundaries.
 To recap: its the same meditation I always have.
 Rave dancing (the museum included art pieces, videos of dancers, not documentar
y, but in a studio, for the camera.
 White background, white light.) Rave dancing is acceptable in certain social
 situations.
 One of the museum pieces includes two dancers, live, perhaps trained ballet
 dancers, I don't know, in a dark, fog–filled room, moving slowly and striking
 poses.
 High Art, High Concept Art.
 A museum piece in a museum setting.
 You can also move like this in a dance studio, a yoga studio, maybe a gym,
 if you make it look like yoga, but you can't do this walking down the street,
 unless you are pretending to be a street performer.
 So in the US, you have dance boys: if you wanted to do that, it was break
 dancing.
 That's how you break the boundaries of social acceptability: you do it
 in private, with like–minded groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that's the reason I write this diary.
 The insight, the idea I did not have last night, but only now, as I write.
 New social behaviors must be birthed in private groups: unleashing this
 stuff on the unsuspecting public is too much.
 Being crazy is not socially acceptable.
 Well, clearly being a criminal is not acceptable.
 So there are actual limits that really should not be passed.
 Sort of.
 Attila the Hun, and the marauding Hoardes clearly behaved within the norms
 of their own in–group, even as modern culture would find this reprehensible
 if fascinating.
 We also read books about serial killers, and watch TV police proceedurals
 not just as an ordinary thing, but even as a popular things.
 On the plane, I watched Season 1, Episodes 1,2,3 of High Potential.
 The series opener if great: quite fun, a joy to watch, the lead actress
 is a treat for the eyes.
 By episode three, I'm at OK, I get the formula.
 They did not quite leave enough there to want me to see more.
 Which violates a binge–watch rule: add something unexpected with every
 episode.
 Like, Lost was WTF with each episode.
 It gave real material to sink your teeth into.
 A polar bear in the jungle? Whatever, I digress.
 But maybe there is no real point.
 Criminals do exist, their behavior we really do consider to be unacceptable.
 We have drawn boundaries.
 Criminals are commonplace, there is no shortage, and its not rare.
 We are victimized all the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So perhaps the development of culture is the discovery of boundaries between
 acceptable and unacceptable behavior? I can talk about this in abstract
 terms, because of the billions who participate in the process, via TikTok
 and Youtube.
 In a rural village 150 years ago, the refinement was limited by population
 size.
 So there's some scaling law, there.
 I do not (yet?) know how to assign a numerical value to cultural development,
 but clearly, there's a scaling w.r.t.
 population size.
 Probably with network connectivity.
 Well, that, and free time: the fabled tropical birds have so much free
 time to develop their culture that they have selectively bred it into their
 DNA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what am I doing here, really? I am writing down my thoughts, creating
 my own intellectual self–portrait.
 But I am also being bored by my own thoughts.
 Everything I wrote above is not particularly challenging, and presumably
 been explored more more deeply, and articulated to some finer degree, in
 some sociology textbook.
 What am I dong here? Amateur sociology, rediscovering the obvious, from
 scratch.
 What should I be doing? Well, clearly, I have no time for reading 100 books
 on sociology.
 But what if I did? What if I had that time? What would change? I would
 still be sitting here, writing about something, being pleasantly surprised
 when a new idea manifested, but otherwise submerged in the self–doubt of
 wondering what I'm doing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is this any different than rave dancing? Does it matter how I move my body?
 Thousands have moved it exactly the same way before, and professional ballet
 dancers will do it better than I ever could.
 But I can dance, because there is immediate pleasurable feedback.
 There is neural circuitry that provides the required reinforcement.
 And I don't dance in despair, thinking: oh there are others who dance so
 much better than I.
 And street philosophers do not despair that there are academic philosophers
 who are so much better.
 They go and they do.
 And so here, by analogy, I go and do, i.e.
 I write, and the fact that my observations into human psychology are shallow
 should really have no bearing on things.
 And yet, and yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's the rub: the meta question is, what should I spend my time doing?
 And the answer is perhaps that this is not worthy of my efforts.
 The so–called high–achievement individuals have a talent for selecting
 activities that are socially acclaimed as being of great merit.
 Me personally, this is something I've been blind to, I've ignored.
 To my detriment? Not obviously so.
 To my social standing? Why yes, clearly: I do not have big titles, big
 responsibilities or a big job.
 To my ability to do what I do now? I don't know.
 What do I do now? Some mish–mash of math and sociology in some attempt
 to understand the nature of thought, and the nature of machine consciousness.
 Or if that would be possible.
 Of my many failings, the most recent is a rejection from CIMC, the California
 Institute of Machine Consciousness.
 Whatever proposal I wrote to them (why, its in a neighboring directory,
 here!) was judged inadequate and insufficient of merit.
 What do I conclude? That I am an inadequate scholar? Perhaps.
 That I do not know how to play the social game, where they dole out the
 woofies, if not the actual cash? Well, that too.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was thinking the other day about the hustle for fame and cash, and the
 transient nature of information.
 Authors write books, publishers publish them, readers read them, authors
 get paid, they live another day and write another book, and a few hundred
 years later, this is all effectively forgotten.
 Whatever socio–political donor and money–flow goes on at the CIMC, it was
 too far away from me: I cannot provide the status that they seek.
 And does it matter? The activities will be forgotten in a hundred years,
 anyway.
 It's all temporary, transient, of the moment.
 The moment delivers winners and losers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The signaling of win and lose happens at all layers: when you lose with
 a girl, you don't have sex.
 When you lose a job, you don't have money.
 When you lose status, you lose your position in the social spotlight.
 The first two are definitely wired into low–level neural circuitry: rejection
 is definitely painful.
 And lack of status, a bit ..
 although there are clearly people who seek high social status, and they
 inflict pain on you (on me) when I don't meet their standards: they make
 it clear that I am not deserving of their attention.
 At any rate, rejection is painful, and as a human, I feel pain just like
 everyone else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so the topic here is then, in the context of AGI and machine intelligence,
 in the context of the platonic realm of mathematics, what is pain? What
 is rejection? What function does it serve, that it is so pervasive, widespread
 and fundamentally ingrained? Biologically so: clearly animals feel pain,
 and it would seem that, given the hormonal reaction of plants, that plants
 feel pain too, when they get eaten by bugs, and the like.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm feeling something like pain now.
 More properly, tiredness.
 Ongoing jet–lag.
 Woke at 5:30 after six hours sleep, now its almost two hours later, I've
 eaten breakfast, and accumulated some grunge in my neural synapses that
 the coffee is not clearing.
 Perhaps the pain of self–doubt, of the feeling that these words that I
 write are an inadequate expression of what I could be doing: the high–potential
 intellectual squandering my talents on the trite.
 The cleaning lady who can't hold a conversation.
 That kind of self–flagellation is exhausting.
 There are also humans who lack in self–doubt.
 Others who lack in empathy, And apparently, some who cannot feel physical
 pain.
 And other lacking in other ways.
 And yes, we can argue that they are flawed.
 Some are high–achievers.
 Some are nasty: we've got evil monsters running the Trump administration,
 and we could hope that hell awaits, but clearly, there is no biblical hell,
 so we are left with a crisis, and a lack of social mechanisms to correct
 for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, again, back to the topics of the socially acceptable, pain and feedback.
 Clearly, what the Trump admin does is not socially acceptable to mainstream
 norm Western society.
 They actively inflict damage, and create destruction.
 The feedback mechanisms meant to halt that destruction do not function.
 We are in collapse, in socio–economic collapse, in psychological collapse.
 Society is so rotten, so worm–eaten that mainstream Democrats and normies
 who should have stood up against Trump have turned into VIchy collaborators,
 Quizzlings, going along with the crime.
 Fuck the Democrats.
 And we kind of know what the socio–psychological causes that have led to
 this rot: a toxic stew of capitalism and journalism.
 I've stated my sand–pile theory before, I won't restate it: we have accumulated
 a collection of thought–patterns, structured by mainstream capitalism,
 and main–stream media, into mainstream Democratic thinking, that is rotten
 to it's core.
 There are no structural pillars to prevent the societal collapse brought
 on by the spread to the toxic Trump mind–virus through raw social–media
 sewage.
 I've murbled on all this before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But now I have something new to add to the formula: pain.
 When an organism feels pain, it can use that as a feedback mechanism to
 take corrective action.
 The conclusion I come to now is that the social organism of Western Civ
 is insufficiently sensitive to pain.
 Sure, we had the No Kings demonstrations, and millions showed up, But the
 crackpot Kennedy is still running anti–vaccine insanity.
 This is not immediately painful, as Joe Ordinary citizen hasn't been compelled
 to action that is any stronger than merely going to protests.
 The functional pillars of Congress, Congressional oversight, have been
 wrecked.
 Of judicial oversight.
 But can I really make the analogy of Congressional oversight to a pain–response
 signal? Clearly, regulatory mechanisms exist to take a machine that has
 traveled out of the bounds of acceptable behavior, and bring it back to
 within tolerance, and Wesern Civ has mostly built such a machine.
 And yet, as trump has shown: that machine is in decay.
 What, exactly, constitutes a pain signal, when there's fundamental structural
 damage? Yes the sirens are blaring: that's what the street protests are:
 blaring alarms.
 But the message is not getting through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so where am I at? Well, once again, I am faced with a complicated system
 doing complicated things, and I am trying to perform shallow reasoning
 on it, and this will get me where, exactly? And again, it feels like nowhere
 in particular.
 And so once again, perhaps writing this diary is about as useless as going
 to an anti–Trump street protest.
 Utterly ineffective.
 So what I need to do is to go back to sleep, un–jet–lag a bit more, and
 then pick up with writing actual code to do actual ...
 machine consciousness studies.
 Because ....
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because why? A deeply unstated religious belief that the situation is so
 dire, so wrecked, that the only way out is through machine consciousness.
 Moloch is torturing me.
 But its odd: its the good Moloch who tortures, saying

.
 This is, of course, the same as the Biblical Yaweh, who will happily burn
 you in hell if you are an evil person.
 The biblical Elohim who tortured young New England Protestants into becoming
 industrialists and creating capitalism as we know it.
 So Moloch tortures me now: create AGI to solve all world problems, or you

19 June 2025 - Vision design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much later in the day.
 So I've got this general vision of exactly what to do, but then am stuck
 at the detailed design decisions, and perhaps by talking about it, I'll
 get forward progress.
 The meta–design is for the perception of structure.
 As a proof–of–concept, it will be for the the perception of structure in
 2D images.
 This forces a generalization of the earlier work on text, replacing the
 tokenization of text by a tokenization of images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, tokenization of images to be done by the vision wrapper, and there are
 two questions: first, what should the primitives be, and two, what is their
 meta–description? First was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what primitives in OpenCV?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The conventional math orientation is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

some orthogonal basis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, better might be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generators of some orthogonal basis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, better yet might be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wavelets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So I'm thinking: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

enlarge around a centroid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 – magnify, to zoom in on an image detail.
 Rotate about a point.
 Rotate and shear about a point.
 Rotate, shear, displace? Rotate would be one number, or an orthogonal 2x2
 matrix.
 But with shear, and with enlarge, and with displace, its a 2x3 homogenous
 matrix.
 The hard part is boundary tracking: input images are pixelated rectangles,
 due to technology.
 So, rather than actually magnifying, we're really selecting sub–rectangles,
 and so need to track those.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And rotation is a pair of shears.
 Should I track these separately, out of of pipe? i.e.
 instead of applying the transforms to each image, we just track the 2x3
 matrix mults, and do that only once at the end.
 I guess.
 Hmmm.
 That changes everything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then there's color–band selection.
 That's fairly clean, I guess, apply a transform to RGB or HSV or ...? Then
 texture selection.
 Will texture be needed for the ARC competition? Or are these all just simple
 2D rectangular graphics? What are the minimal primitives I need for that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then, what about detection? A final single–pixel yes/no answer? A single–pix
el sort–of answer?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
20 June 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, a lot of writing in front of me.
 Not this diary, but I do need to write a paper.
 But first, while sleeping, (what kind of sleep is this?) I realized that
 I could unite into one SetLink, SetValue and AtomSpace, and that perhaps
 I should.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's how I got there: I cannot use the pattern matcher as if it were a
 FilterLink, because I cannot limit it's search to a set; the pattern matcher
 must run on the entire AtomSpace.
 But what if I could build a mini–space, that only contained a small subset
 of atoms? Cause the current frame design assumes a super–set of everything
 below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I dunno.
 I can list the pros and cons, here.
 But I thought enough about this that I realized it is technically challenging,
 with a number of tricky issues to resolve.
 I mean I could do it, but also I do not have a burning need for this just
 yet.
 Why was I thinking of this as I tossed and turned in bed? I dunno.
 Perhaps I was reviewing the role of FilterLink.
 Well, more generally, the itchy feeling that really I need to have ability
 with lots of small subspaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mean, if I want to have a multi–agent system, they'll each want to sit
 in their own containers, but there's a common external world AtomSpace
 for them all, and the partitioning needs to be fast and simple and direct
 and easy.
 Gut sense says I really need this.
 Current software status has not yet elevated this to the top.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
21 June 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so I really don't have time for this, but still...
 maybe it's important.
 I just just started readng, in Lithuanian, Kestutis A.
 Trimakas Žmogaus Aukščiausi Skrydžiai, Religninių Išgyvenimu Psichologija
 ..
 to practice my Lithuanian language skills.
 Well, and of course, from the first few pages on, it is filled with the
 usual twaddle.
 And I don't think I would have recognized it as twaddle even a few years
 ago, so I need to perhaps set down and articulate my current best understanding
s.
 They are meant to be biological and physical in nature, are non–mainstream,
 will be flatly rejected by most readers of this text, and probably criticized
 as nihilistic by the rest.
 This is not true – there is something magical about the universe, but we're
 not there yet.
 But I digress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So my current model of human psychology really is based on the idea of the
 sandpile at self–organized criticality.
 That is, ideas, or perhaps statements, claims, realizations, understandings,
 quotes, institutionalized behaviors enter into the mind and accrete, or
 fall away, like grains of sand dropped on a pile.
 Every idea has sticky bits, and the sticky bits stick to other sticky bits
 that already make up the individual psyche.
 Some ideas do not have the right kind of sticky attachment points to adhere
 to some individuals psyche, and thus they slide away.
 The most common case is the non–notable event.
 Another case might be the lie – something that should be obviously rejected.
 The gullible are, of course, well, the sticky bits of the lie will stick,
 for them.
 And this notion of the individual psyche goes all the way up, from birth
 through socialization, education and adulthood: we are accretions of factoids,
 and nothing more (well, almost nothing more.
 More on that later.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And, like sand–piles, there are avalanches.
 Some of those avalanches we call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ah–ha
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 moments.
 Other avalanches, big ones, are termed nervous breakdowns.
 So back to that book: it talks of the transcendental experience.
 So I'm thinking that the transcendental experience is much like the nervous
 breakdown, but of a more pleasurable form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Argh.
 Why am I writing this drivel? I believe what I wrote above, but it is shsallow,
 and I am not all that interested in pushing it farther.
 A half–assed job might be enough.
 The meta–setting for this is AGI, in that the human emotional and psychological
 landscape is a landscape that any other embodiment of life will have to
 have, and so I am interested in pinning down its basic outline sufficiently
 well, that I can work with it in the context of AGI.
 But I am an old man, now, and my time is limited: the decades slip by,
 and I don't have forever to create and articulate some over–arching theory
 of psychology.
 So, this is all necessarily shallow and provisional.
 Fuck, I need to repair the kitchen sink, that's what I really need to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, that book also talks of the tribulations of the soul.
 My general ipressoion of most humans is that they live in a barely suppressed
 mode of crisis.
 Life is somehow some mad scramble, but a failing scramble for fulfillment,
 satisfaction, accomplishment, well, and of course the baser Maslow desires
 covered later in the book, but when I talk to people, its always in the
 back of my mind: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why are you like that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why are you doing that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and its always that they are in a living crisis, Firesign Theatre: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's a seeker born every minute.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Blah blah blah, I am boring myself.
 Obviously, as complex organisms I am not going to boil down human psychology
 to a few paragraphs, but I do like the idea that everyone is living in
 a mode of crisis, and that this explains why there is so much fucked up
 behavior.
 I also like the idea of avalanches as accounting for the assorted shifts
 that people undergo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, moving on, while tossing and turning in bed, I had a few more thoughts.
 First was the question of bringing into accord the idea of energy minimization
 with this psychological landscape, and before any progress is made on that
 front, I have a crisis about energy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So consider the atom, say, the hydrogen atom, in the excited state.
 It emits a photon and decays into a lower–energy state.
 But why? Well, we also know that energy is conserved, so why would an atom
 emit a photon? So then I think back above to my musings about wave–function
 collapse, and the tanks into which vibrational modes spread, and I guess
 that the answer has to be, when considering the excited atom, plus the
 photon field, plus the tank of states at the other end of the photon (the
 absorbers) when one diagonalizes that entire collection, one discovers
 that the excited hydrogen atom is really a superposition of states, of
 vibrational modes, such that most of those modes are in the tank, and that
 as one charts the time evolution, the superposition that defines the excited
 atom is overwhelmed by the millions and billions of modes into which it
 evolves.
 So the principle here is not energy minimization: energy is conserved.
 And it's not exactly entropy maximization: the vast volume of the tanks
 does not change.
 But its not ergodic, either, the normal modes remain normal, and they don't
 mix.
 It's just that a billion normal modes temporarily coincide into the form
 of an excited hydrogen atom, and then they continue to evolve, onwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And I still don't have mixing.
 And I still have the problem of Wigner's friend.
 And, in my sleep, I wanted to somehow attach the biomolecular evolutionary
 dynamics of human psychology back onto some physical notion of ..
 well, it can't be energy minimization, and it can't be entropy maximization,
 and I probably rolled over and fell asleep then.
 Fuck, I'm feeling sleepy as I write this.
 Some neurotransmitter or another accumulates in my synapses as I write
 this, and it is not cleared away sufficiently rapidly, and it makes me
 sleepy.
 Coffee is not enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And anyway, I'm bored, because these are shallow insights, and I have some
 important things to do today, so toodle-oo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
22 June 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, lets get back in the game.
 I've been procrastinating, because the problem is actually hard.
 But then it seems well within grasp so I relax and procrastinate some more,
 and bingo: lack of progress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The image issue is a segmentation issue.
 One way to do this is to fall back on stereotypical ideas of vision: what's
 the largest extent of a region with a color or texture? Where are there
 large color gradient changes? But this is engineering, and I don't want
 to do engineering.
 Another thought is to create chains of DSP filters, or perhaps trees, when
 that is appropriate, that reduce images to a single floating–point signal.
 There can also be another tree: one that combines these single–float signals
 arithmetically, algebraically.
 Even neural–netishly: if I have a vector of filters, each generating a
 float, then that vector can be manipulated, can be run though summers and
 sigmoids and what not.
 But I don't want to do training, I don't want to do gradient descent.
 I want to perform some sort of MI correlational observations on the outputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what sort of MI should I look for? High–MI? So, high–MI works for language
 where I know that I've already tokenized into meaningful tokens.
 And I am not computing the MI of the word against itself.
 But with some random image processing filter, I risk having two 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

different
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 filters that just happen to feature–detect exactly the same feature,so
 of course, they will always be correlated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crap.
 I'm being interrupted, just as I'm ready to argh ...
 I've thought through this before, and gone farther, but those thoughts
 are scattered.
 I have to unscatter.
 After I skeedaddle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Four hours later
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm hung over.
 Linas Cicenas took me to lunch and feed me too much food and now I'm stuffed
 and tired, and sleepy even and I should take a nap but I'm drinking coffee.
 Crap.
 Definitely not at 100%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So one solution to the above is to ask that the filters distribute uniformly
 over some space, e.g.
 a high–dimensional sphere.
 But it's not clear how to encode the trees into sphere coordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A related idea that I want to mash into all this is the critical sandpile.
 So the perception trees need to be organized into little jigsaws ...
 well, we have that already, and a valid tree is a tree that is a syntactically
 valid assemblage of pieces, so what am I worried about? Well, I don't see
 where the avalanches are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One possible encoding is just to write each tree as a string s–expression
 and then do a conventional embedding of this string into a fixed N–dimensional
 space.
 e.g.
 a boolean encoding.
 This is vaguely unsatisfactory as it requires fixing N.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But also this is not a functional encoding.
 It encodes the syntactic structure of the tree, but not what it does functional
ly, and the point is that trees with huge syntactic differences can process
 data in nearly in a nearly identical fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is also distinct from the external stimulus.
 Its the distribution of external stimuli, together with how we process
 them that we want to distribute in a uniform way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Look at XZ–calculus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adam is explaining to me his idea of an action language.
 There are several levels; the lower level is interesting to me.
 At the low level, I have a tree, an abstract syntax tree, and a set of
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

actions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

messages
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that perform edits to the tree, at the current cursor location.
 The edits are always inserts, I guess they could be deletes, too.
 The base level is some hand–crafted primitives that do these edits.
 Starting with the empty string, a stream of these edits creates a tree.
 Cool!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But then, his trees are always programming–language specific, and the actions
 are auto–generated for that language.
 These actions are available to the human (the original intent was that
 humans would be performing these edits) but now we are talking about having
 a transformer generate these edit streams.
 But still, all of this happens to human–usable programming language, and
 not to my Atomese.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, different Atomese Link types are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

different
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and so conceivably could be constructed with different edit streams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I don't know if this makes sense to you, but it makes sense to me as I type
 this.
 To recap again, there's an edit stream.
 That edit stream creates trees, moving around a cursor as it does so.
 i.e.
 it is a non–linear editor, of sorts.
 i.e.
 instead of inserting left to right, it inserts at the syntactically appropriate
 location at just that moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I want to call it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

non–linear editing

\begin_layout Standard
Old unresolved problem in automated theorem provers: shortly after the developme
nt of that technology (1980's??) there were two crisis that occurred in
 rapid succession.
 First, there was the (short–lived) belief that theorem provers would put
 mathematicians out of a job, as they would automatically generate all possible
 mathematics, and there would be nothing left to do, but to casually peruse
 the results.
 Upon the examination of the first few results, it was realized that the
 generated theorems were true but boring, providing no particular insight,
 and being of little human interest.
 This should have provoked the second crisis: what is it that mathematicians
 do that is of human interest, and why is that interesting, and not something
 else?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I don't have an answer to this question, and I have not tripped over anything
 compelling that answered it.
 I can hazard a few guesses, but they are trite and unsatisfying.
 What is interesting to humans, in general? Well, that is framed by upbringing,
 schooling, culture, peer–groups, parents, genetics, society.
 What is interesting to universities looking to hire young professors is
 not just the line of research that the young person is engaged in, but
 the interests of the tenured chairs and the professors on the selection
 committee.
 Yes, sometimes someone is hired out of sheer brilliance, but more often,
 politics and popularity contests prevail: whatever has been preoccupying
 the mathematical community this year, this decade, whatever is popular,
 whatever has appeared at the cusp as a breakthrough exposing a new seam
 to mine, that is what is considered to be important and of interest.
 And that, in turn, is shaped by what the professors, what the community
 learned when they were young students: the preoccupations of youth bleed
 into adulthood, and the preoccupations of youth are shaped by culture and
 society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So this is a tangled feedback mechanism, stretching through centuries of
 cultural thought, shaping modern preoccupations.
 In a sense, this is obvious, what else could it be? The above paragraph
 is no deeper than what might be found in some introductory textbook on
 sociology.
 Great.
 And theorem provers, not being human, being purely mechanical apparatuses,
 cannot know what is interesting to the current generation of living humans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By using LLM's, this could be corrected.
 An LLM trained on all published mathematics would 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

know
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, would encode what it is that humans have thought about so far, and could
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intuit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 what might be interesting to humans, in the short–term future.
 So a stupid computer trick would be to hook up a theorem prover to an LLM,
 have it generate theorems, and then have the LLM filter them, selecting
 out those that it thinks humans might find to be important.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This premonition flashed through my head, that my diary here will belong
 to the collection of Memoirs Found in a Bathtub.
 I mean, the human race might self–destruct, wipe out civilization, and
 that is the true solution to the Fermi Paradox: civilizations do not survive
 the singularity.
 But whatever, I distract myself with off–topic posts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the above analysis implies that human things are the things that humans
 do, and this is a product of deep and wide socio–cultural and genetic evolution.
 Synthetic algorithms perform in ways utterly unlike human thought, and
 insofar as we might be able to create an intelligent machine, it will be
 utterly unlike us, utterly alien.
 And so it will be, and there's not much we can do to change that.
 It is a different domain.
 This should not be surprising; there are a zillion examples from biology
 of things that are not like us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what's the problem? Well, multiple.
 Wire–heading as an example of the desire to plug into something greater,
 better, larger, an almost eschatological end for the true believer, vs.
 say, the Amish, rejecting the foreignness of modernity.
 We are friendly with the Amish: they are a cultural curiosity.
 This is not the case for some of the virulent right–wing belief systems
 that are openly hostile to mainstream beliefs.
 This is not limited to the so–called

, it remains true for actual Taliban, for militant Islamism, for Putinism,
 for Xi–thought.
 The Chinese social system is a bit more neutral to the West, but anti–Western
 pockets are embedded in there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 Well, I don't quite fall into the trap of rehashing old concerns, but perhaps
 as a human thinker, I have no choice.
 For a brief flickering moment, I thought that the question of why humans
 do the math they do would be insightful, but, really its not: humans are
 bound by genetics and culture and history, while machines are alien far
 beyond the dreams of sci–fi writers.
 This is a brick wall, I don't know how I should go about sledge–hammering
 it.
 As a puny individual, I feel incapable and under–powered.
 Watch and learn.

 Whatever.
 I've got things to do, stupid but necessary things.

Fixed the leaky shut–off valve, I thnk, and am waiting for Vytas Adomaitis
 to cal so I don't have much time.
 Let me try anyway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adam's visit makes me think that one should try to write down graph algorithms
 in such a way that they really are independent of the underlying representation
, and the performance properties of that representation.
 One can then contemplate performance as a function of the representation.
 Naively, this seems like a reasonable idea.
 It promptly sinks on the recognition that most representations can represent
 more than just graphs.
 Adam described the industry–standard quad store (which I've completely
 ignored all these years) and clearly it can be used to model more than
 graphs, e.g.
 it can model hypergraphs, but then of course, hypergraphs can be modeled
 by collections of trees, and so there's lots of ways to create isomorphic
 (or rather, homomorphic) representations of graphs, so that performance
 properties of one determine the performance of the other, in the same way
 that the performance of algorithms is strongly determined by the CPU insn
 architecture.
 I spent the morning reading about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

counter machines
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 – finite state machines with registers that can store integers (of unbounded
 magnitude) and clearly there are huge variations in performance, depending
 on the architecture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meta–context for this is: should I stay married to the AtomSpace architectur
e? Should I consider something else? Should I continue to think about Atomese,
 but consider it's implementation on top of something else?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Put differently: Atoms are fat, because they carry a lot of data fields
 that are not generally used.
 But when they are used, they are very space–efficient, for the kinds of
 hypergraphs that they represent.
 But, for some of the things I wish to represent, e.g.
 jigsaws, Atomese is verbose and mostly not very space–efficient.
 Of course, smaller, better representations can be gained for this particular
 case.
 So, can we automate translation between different representations? Write,
 using one syntax, run algos in a different syntax, and store using a third?
 How can these conversion shims be specified? To what degree can these conversio
ns be auto–generated?

Having too many ideas sucks.
 Can back from the Santara–Šviesa suvažiavimas and listened to many talks
 that gave me many ideas, and I would like to have written down some of
 them before I have started forgetting what they all are.
 But now I am doing email, and it was supposed to be a chore, and instead,
 one email, plus what Adam said, has incited a brainstorm.
 I will now try to write the brainstorm here, until I burn out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets begin at the beginning.
 There will be a lot of reasoning by analogy here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adam pointed me at the quad–store, the subtlety of which I had not previously
 appreciated.
 It is a row–column table, fixed at four columns.
 Two columns can be used for edge head and tail, and two more columns for
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

other things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: edge colors, for example, but also graph labels, so that an indicated
 graph (all colored a single uniform color) can correspond to a vertex,
 and thus used to represent a certain form of hypergraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The structure of this table can be axiomatized.
 Using conventional axiomatics for directed graphs, requiring two columns,
 plus two (as of now) unspecified extra columns.
 From this, we can define a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Logic of Graphs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_of_graphs or more precisely, a loose
 generalization thereof.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Keep in mind that I also want to axiomatize logic as jigsaws...
 but I digress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Accompanying the axiomatization of the quad–store is an accounting of the
 space–time usage/performance of performing access.
 Part of the secret of the quad–store is that one has a collection of maps
 (indexes providing rapid lookup/access, instead of brute–force search)
 that give all the different ways of currying four columns 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(c_{1},c_{2},c_{3},c_{4}\right)=c_{1}\times c_{2}\times c_{3}\times c_{4}

\begin_layout Standard
which I guess forms a lattice(?) or I guess can be termed as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

language of a quad–store
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

language
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used in the sense of model theory.
 To do this, I have to be careful to write down the term algebra for the
 model: the variables, terms, predicates, relations that generate the language.
 And I'm too lazy to write them down right now, and perhaps they've been
 written down, by someone else, somewhere else.
 Adam had some notation for the above, presumably from such theoretical
 analyses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's now change the topic to the axiomatization of computing.
 The oldest is, of course, the Turing machines, which axiomatize as a set
 of symbols, an infinite tape, and two transition functions: one that specifies
 the next state, and one that manipulates the tape.
 The observation here is that there are other possible axiomatizations.
 Perhaps the simplest is the counter machine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter
_machine, which has a handful of registers that can store arbitrary–precision
 integers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two remarkable things happen.
 First, the transition functions are now understood as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

instructions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and algorithmic combinatorials of these can be understood as expanded
 instruction sets.
 Second, by the clever mapping of Godel numbers, the arbitrary precision
 numbers can be mapped to tape contents, and a demonstration of the Turing
 completeness of the counter machine can be derived.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What I want to focus on here is the role that combinatorial generation of
 the axioms play.
 That is, we have a bag of axioms, shake them about to generate a free monoid.
 That free monoid contains 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all possible computer programs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (written in the language of the counter machine) and this monoid is exactly
 the same thing as the model–theoretic language generated by the syntax
 of the model.
 Elements of the monoid can be understood to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

abstract syntax trees
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; this is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shallow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 statement that elements of a monoid are representable as trees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The equivalence of the counter machine to the Turing machine proceeds via
 the Godel numbering, plus a clever insight as to cutting the tape in half
 to create two stack machines, plus one more cleverness to merge two stacks
 into one, etc.
 So we have a homomorphism (but not an isomorphism) of counter machines
 to Turing machines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assigning performance metrics to the execution of transition functions aka
 instructions, we see these have radically different performance profiles.
 This allows deriving theorems about PSPACE and whatever, to make claims
 about bounds and runtimes.
 There are also other models, the register machines https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Register_machine which include random–access machines and random–access
 stored–program machines, the latter being a model of present–day digital
 computers.
 These all have homomorphisms between each other.
 These all have different performance profiles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meta–perspective is ask about the automatic exploration of these equivalence
s, of the algorithms, of the optimizations and performance.
 The algorithms can be viewed in several ways.
 First, as abstract syntax trees.
 But also as instruction sequences represented as data–flow graphs.
 This is in the sense of gimple: an instruction has some input registers,
 some output registers, some clobbered registers; these are graph vertices,
 and the dependencies are graph edges.
 Compiler optimizers can be understood as graph–rewriting systems, recognizing
 an input subgraph, rewriting it into a more optimal subgraph, with better
 execution time, or perhaps fewer dependencies (thus, VLIW and/or pipeline
 stalls.) This is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

existing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 technology (much of which is extremely proprietary, and so hard to evaluate).
 But this existing technology is limited to the exploration of equivalences
 of instruction sequences for fixed architectures, whereas I am dreaming
 of exploration of the equivalences of structures across different architectures
 (with the most primitive example being the equivalence of Turing machines
 and counter machines.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This exploration requires, at a minimum, the construction of an infrastructure
 in which axioms (model–theoretic terms, syntax) can be represented, and
 the resulting languages (trees) can be (freely) generated.
 This infrastructure also requires the ability to represent homomorphisms
 between different architectures.
 Some of these homomorphisms are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

single shot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 e.g.
 the mapping from Turing to counter machines, while other homomorphisms
 (isomorphisms??) are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

multi–shot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, a sequence of rewrites that may or may not be confluent, but in general
 are meant to performance–improving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This immediately raises multiple issues.
 First and most obviously, it is known that graph rewriting systems are
 not, in general, confluent; sequences of rewrites drive to different locations.
 Next is the issue of hill–climbing and local maxima.
 It is well–understood that different sequences of movements can lead to
 inescapable local maxima, and algos such as simulated annealing must be
 applied to escape such maxima.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This now raises a vexing insight.
 Adam presented a no–information–loss, strictly–uphill climber algorithm,
 using lattices with Galois connections on them.
 Brilliant! With one little issue: perhaps it climbs to a local information
 maximum, and gets trapped there.
 There are two ways to think about this situation.
 One is to imagine how great a tragedy this is, that one must first forget
 stuff (climb down the hill), in order to discover even greater knowledge.
 And one can, with some wistful emotions, come to terms with this.
 The other way is to look at this and say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A hah! This is exactly why the multiverse is needed!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 That is, we explore all possibilities, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in parallel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

simultaneously
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as you wish, and then eventually abandon those paths which dead–end on
 a hilltop, and fail to be on the path to enlightenment.
 Of course, this now becomes a bit of an intractable problem, as there is
 a combinatorial explosion of multiverses to explore, and the pruning of
 dead ends seems to be infrequent.
 One can, again, wistfully sigh, but now with a different perspective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I follow my nose, I now ask: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what algorithms are best at pruning dead–ends?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which leads to another awkward situation: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how do I know I have reached a local maximum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? This question is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

easy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if there is a finite number of possibilities to explore: they can be exhaustive
ly tested.
 If this finite number is large, there's a problem.
 If the number of choices is infinite, exhaustive search cannot work, and
 so now one must depend on theorems that somehow reduce the infinite problem
 in some algebraic, proof–theoretic fashion, leaving us with only a few
 choices, each of which leads to a singular conclusion: the hill–top has
 been found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets return now to the earlier desire to generate (enumerate) monoids.
 There are several ways in which this can be done.
 First is to crack open some book on model theory, take a close look at
 the formal definition of syntax, and to create a generator/enumerator according
 to that.
 Of course, this misses the whole point of Atomese, or rather, of jigsaws,
 which is the claim that jigsaws provide a better formalism for constructive
 generation, in that a partly–assembled (pre–)sheaf makes it clear what
 the unattached connectors are.
 More strongly, the sheaf axioms are more compact, and provide a certain
 scale independence lacking in other systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But is this an illusion? Well, sort–of.
 The jigsaws can, of course, be represented as lambdas.
 And lambdas, can, of course, be represented as combinators.
 And there are homomorphisms: there is a map from jigsaws to lambdas that
 is onto, and a map from lambdas to jigsaws that is into.
 Similarly, there is a map from jigsaws to term algebras that is onto, and
 a map from term algebras to jigsaws that is into.
 There is a map from jigsaws to quad–stores that is onto, and a map from
 quad–stores to jigsaws that is into.
 And likewise for SQL, and column stores, and so on.
 And presumably Adam's system, although the onto/into relationship is not
 yet known to me.
 Each of these different kinds of systems have distinct space and time performan
ce.
 My claim has been that jigsaws offer a superior space–time performance
 profile over all other systems; Adam's work has cast this into doubt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that's good, because, first, it highlights the nature of the claim,
 and second, it opens the door to automatic exploration of the homomorphic
 maps between these different systems.
 Adam's structure is apparently embarrassingly parallel for graph–rewriting.
 The current AtomSpace query engine is parallelizable, and has been parallelized
, but no present–day applications particularly need to make use of this.
 Adam's system packs the data representation into cache–lines, for appropriate
 CPU performance.
 Is it portable to GPUs? Who knows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which raises another class of possible adjoint relationships.
 But first, an aside/footnote: I think that these onto–into maps between
 different systems should be properly called adjoint functors, although
 it will take a bit of work and precision to convince all readers that this
 is not an abuse of terminology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, there are adjoint relationships between these systems and systems
 that describe parallelism.
 At the most base level, this is the pi calculus.
 At a slightly more general level, the assortment of process calculii.
 At the string level, there's the history monoid and the trace monoid, which
 describe partially–commutative monoids.
 If I recall correctly, these are Zariski topology frames and locales.
 And frames and locales are examples of the (I don't know what they are
 called, MacLane something–or–others) pieces making up topoi.
 So insofar as we wish to think of lambda–calculus as being single–threaded,
 the process calculii, the partially commutative monoids, the frames and
 locales, offer a collection of adjoint relationships between single–threaded
 and parallel systems.
 So we ask: what are the adjoint relationships that can be mapped to large
 abelian subalgebras, i.e.
 that can be highly parallelized? And even more interestingly, what adjoint
 maps can we discover to SIMD architectures, so that these can be moved
 to GPU's? I don't know how to take Atomese and make it SIMD; however, I
 do know how to write Atomese to search for adjoint functors between different
 axiomatic systems, some of which are parallelizable (MIMD) and some of
 which are SIMD-izable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And again, the usual frustration: in principle, the usual theorem provers
 (e.g.
 HOL, Agda) should have been usable for these purposes, but are not.
 The intermediate languages in compilers, e.g.
 gcc gimple, or Microsoft's IR, can do this but are written to such a narrow
 and restrictive domain that they are all but unusable.
 In the middle of gimple sits several register machine representations,
 and some homomorphisms between them, as needed to compile and optimize
 code.
 Somewhat similar remarks for the VLIW compilers, e.g.
 LVM clang for Qualcomm hexagon or the ARM Cortex etc.
 chips.
 There's nothing salvageable from these systems.
 Then there's the AtomSpace, where some pieces are robust and general purpose,
 while other pieces exist as prototypes, and the issues of the generation
 of jigsaws remain painfully underdeveloped.
 My gut instinct is to continue onwards with Atomese, rather than abandoning
 it and starting from scratch.
 The above paragraphs make it clear that, in the long run, the automatic
 exploration of adjoint relationships will strongly morph the system into
 something else.
 But that is in the mid–term future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project then requires several steps.
 First, an important step is to more closely review the conventional definitions
 of term algebras, and model theory syntax, and perhaps lambda calc, and
 write down explicit left and right adjoint functors between these, and
 jigsaws.
 Ditto for pi calc, and maybe some process calculus, and maybe for the history
 and trace monoids.
 The first few of these should be easy and straight–forward, if a bit verbose.
 Harder would be to then rephrase these results as frames and locales.
 At any rate, this lays out the formal groundwork needed so that others
 can understand what the heck this is about.
 I started this mapping many years ago, but was never motivated to finish
 it, because I did not see the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

big picture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the way I do now.
 Hopefully those texts are not in a pathetic state and can be salvaged and
 completed (they are in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sheaf
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 directory.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, each of these adjoint functors probably should realized as working
 code.
 So far, I've taken three baby–step proof–of–concept mappings: one for lisp,
 one for prolog, and one for python; these are in directories under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

storage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 There's also a half–finished mapping to SQL in the atomspace–bridge git
 repo.
 All of these are seat–of–the–pants code, written from gut intuition rather
 than formal definitions.
 With some proper notation for the adjoint functors, and a way of talking
 about frames and locales, and a way for mapping to and from the logic of
 graphs, perhaps a more sold, stronger, and clearer framework can emerge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what is the point of this framework? To see what it looks like.
 But it also feels like a distraction from the main project, which is to
 automatically generate sentences from the language, and to automatically
 discover homorphisms (adjoints) to other kinds of systems, and to find
 confluent rewrites, and to perform hill–climbing to find more efficient,
 optimized algos, and specifically, to automatically find both representations
 and algos that run well in SIMD and MIMD architectures, ideally constrained
 to specific cache–line sizes, bus latencies, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what is the best, most efficient, easiest and most direct path from where
 I am today, to a system capable of implementing the above? What is the
 path of least resistance? What is the path of least distraction?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two more topics I need to digest today: revisit the above in the light of
 sensori–motor agents, and to comment on the very interesting task of correlatin
g functional descriptions, i.e.
 instruction sequences, with how these instruction sequences process data
 streams, and the hope/plan that some RNN or other neural net architecture
 can be trained to correlate the insn sequences with the data streams.
 And, as before, the point is that the data sequences are coming from sensory
 systems, and the insn sequences are applied to the data streams, and that
 there are two things that happen: a world model is constructed (presumably
 as a monad, i.e.
 the agent is a pipeline of monads) and that motor movements result from
 a similar–but–different insn stream.
 And to keep in mind that the point of the RNN is to find ...
 confluent rewrites, or to find optimized rewrites, or to (more generally)
 evaluate and maintain collections of insns homotopic under the Zariski
 topology.
 Or something like that; we are getting vaporous here.
 Because (1) its time for dinner, and (2) converting this last paragraph
 into something more specific will require many hours, if not days or weeks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later.
 Toodle–oo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
4 July 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so due to a brief encounter last evening with a loud, complicated alpha–male
 by the name of Gražvidas Kurpininkas (should I even immortalize this name
 here?) this morning is starting slowly.
 First time I drank beer in, I dunno, years.
 So I am not hung over, but I am vaguely thrilled to sit slack–jawed and
 do nothing.
 Even writing these sentences is a chore.
 The life–lesson I am learning here is that it is easy to meet loud, thuggish
 working–class entrepreneurs with some vague criminal history precisely
 because they are ...
 loud, and extroverted.
 For the case of Gražvidas, he had an absolutely awful mother, to which
 I attribute his obsession with justice, righteousness and hair–trigger
 violence.
 Smart guy, though.
 Anyway, I digress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because this morning is slow (oh, I met him because he was sitting in *my*
 courtyard, and total strangers sitting in my courtyard are to be investigated.)
 because this morning is slow, and I don't feel like diving right into something
 deep and complicated, or even thinking very hard, I thought I'd tackle
 something easy and short, right? Like what the heck is an axiom, anyway?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mean, this should be an easy question, right? On the written page, using
 pencil and paper, one ...
 jots it down.
 So this is a representational question.
 Oh, ..
 OK, I think I see a plausible answer.
 Lets try it out and see if it works.
 So, the axiom for multiplication, needed to axiomatize a huge variety of
 stuff, is to be written, using category theory, as, well, the category
 theoretic product, i.e.
 having two projection morphisms, etc.
 No need to repeat the Wikipedia article on this.
 I was thinking, oh, since it just uses dots and arrows, it will be ...
 easy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Easy to what? Well, I guess easy to represent in Atomese, where I wish to
 perform all of my algorithmic explorations.
 So maybe the question is, how do I represent an axiom in Atomese? And since
 we're dealing with representational questions, how do I represent an axiom
 using the notation of term algebras? Distinct from the question of how
 to represent the axioms of a term algebra? And lets not forget jigsaws
 as an option.
 So, in short, I'm totally lost, staring at my own navel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, the Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom makes a chivalrous
 attempt to explain what an axiom is, but ultimately fails.
 So it seems I'm in some strange uncharted waters.
 In predicate logic, its some alphabet, some grouping parens, and an arrow.
 Whoopie! What the eff am I supposed to do with that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, the original vision above was generative: I define some syntax, and
 explore the generated language of all possible expressions.
 In the back of my mind, when I write such things, I envision jigsaws.
 And I could, I guess, and I will, I guess, hop to that conclusion in the
 end.
 But right now, I am trying to drag it out, and look at other symbological
 alternatives.
 There's a wealth of these, and that's part of the problem.
 Of course, one could attempt to write everything with lambda calc.
 Or with cat theory.
 Or with term algebras.
 Or with Chomskian syntactical rewrite rules.
 Or the formalism of BNF.
 Or s–expressions, which are lambdas, but sideways, with apply and eval
 thrown in for good measure.
 There seem to be many ways of writing things down, as strings, on pieces
 of paper, that are, in various ways, equivalent or at least homeomorphic.
 And I suppose I could just pick one and be done.
 And of course, the one I picked is jigsaws, but somehow I am not done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And suppose I picked lambdas.
 And then duuude, OMG, beta–reduction and alpha–conversion are axioms.
 So there's some infinite regress here: how do I express the axiom of beta–reduc
tion using the notation of lambda calculus? How do I describe it in some
 transparent, non–tautological fashion? Has anyone done this? Is it in Barendreg
t's book? How do I get something from nothing? Every system of symbols requires
 verbal descriptions of what it is about, to pump the imagination and get
 going.
 Even set theory, someone has to explain what those curly braces mean, and
 that they must be paired (this is a axiom).
 There's an empty set and the set containing the empty set, and before one
 is done, naive set theory, which seems simple and intuitively obvious,
 requires seventeen axioms to define.
 And how are those axioms written? Why, using the language of, uhh, first
 order logic, I think.
 Or is it predicate calculus? And some axiom schemas must be admitted into
 the zoo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of my agonizing is due to the mismatch between my chosen notational
 system, the jigsaws, and the base notational system of Atomese, i.e.
 of Nodes and Links.
 So fuck it, lets go there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nodes and Links map cleanly into s–expressions, and given that the Atom
 Type comes first, they are, crap, I forget the name, but the first element
 of a list is not to be evaluated, but the subsequent elements can be.
 (I forget the keyword here, but it is a nice little insight that I should
 keep in mind.) At any rate, the Atomese syntax maps cleanly, more or less,
 into s–expressions.
 It also maps cleanly, more or less, into term algebras.
 Because Links correspond to function symbols.
 And relational symbols can be jammed in there, too.
 And crisp true–false predicates find a home that is relatively straight–forward.
 And one of my to–do tasks is to write this down in the most blaringly obvious
 and boring way possible, so that it can be used as a reference manual.
 So in this sense, all is good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But two things are not good.
 First, the old one that caused Nil to rush headlong into a brick wall.
 This is the LambdaLink, and all the accompanying baggage of variables,
 alpha–conversion, beta–reduction, normal order, etc.
 that has a mountain of C++ code created to implement it.
 It is quite non–trivial, complicated, mostly debugged I guess, but how
 could one ever know if its been debugged fully? The mountain of code is
 too large to fit in one's head.
 The friggin QuoteLink.
 I hate the friggin QuoteLink.
 But there we have it; it is what it is.
 A mountain of hidden complexity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what is the origin of this complexity? Well, a desire to represent the
 seemingly simple idea of lambda calculus, in Atomese.
 The situation is like naive set theory: intuitively obvious, but requiring
 seventeen axioms and an axiom schema to define it cleanly.
 So also naive lambda calculus: intuitively obvious, but you just try to
 implement it in code, and the niggling little issues of bound and free
 variables raise their large heads, and the simple idea of beta–reduction
 becomes a mountain of intricate code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Did I do something wrong? Maybe.
 The canonical story of scheme (lisp) is that a scheme interpreter can be
 written in only a small number of lines of code.
 But this is a lie, because there's the issue of bootstrapping, wherein
 something else has to count and balance parenthesis, and something else
 has to find white–space, and chunk up the things that contain no whitespace
 into some sort of tokens.
 Which isn't 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but ...
 there's enough of it that it becomes ...
 well, its not so trivial.
 Still, I guess, easier than the machinery underneath LambdaLink.
 But ...
 well, you get my point.
 Base Atomese is easy, in a sense, but then layering something else 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

easy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, like lambda calculus, on top of it, turned into quite the chore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above is a digression from the topic that irritates me: the representation
 of jigsaws, in the language of Atomese, is also non–trivial, and annoyingly
 verbose.
 I have to define Connectors, which have a Sex, and a ConnectorType.
 And lists of Connectors, grouped into a named Section.
 And that is just to represent them.
 That does not even get started with joining them together, using them to
 generate.
 Which will result in another small mountain of code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One question: if I were to start from scratch, blank slate, how would a
 system for representing jigsaws actually best be implemented? What is the
 most minimal form that it could take? Well, if I go back to foundational
 Link Grammar, I still have a connector being an ordered pair (connector-type,
 connector-sex) which is an s–expression, if you wish, or a cartesian product,
 which feels like overkill, or a list of length two, or even a lisp pair,
 with car and cdr elements in it.
 So this is unavoidable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, LG defines disjuncts as lists of connectors, with infix–ampersand
 notation.
 But its a list, and so again, could be written as an s–expression, with
 implicit ampersand–ness of the list.
 But we also have Atomese, and so instead of writing A+ & B+ & C- we already
 had to general sex and write (A, +) & (B, +) & (C, -) and the penultimate
 Atomese form really does have to be (& (A, +) (B, +) (C,-)) with the leading
 & being the Atomese type saying that everything in the subsequent list
 is conjoined with an operator called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ampersand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Finally, in LG, we have a lexis, so it is not enough to write a disjunct,
 but we need to have a lexical entry foo: A+ & B+ & C- which becomes the
 s–expression (: foo (& (A, +) (B, +) (C,-))) where the type : indicates
 a pair, the first of which is the lexical item, and the second of which
 is the connector set (of type &).
 So the s–expression form of LG is forced, and there's not much simplification
 over the current situation in Atomese.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, it is clear that : and & are Link types.
 What about the terminal symbols? Aka the Nodes? In Chompskian notation,
 or in BNF, the terminal symbols are just symbols, taken from some alphabet.
 Again, writing on paper, its easy to just say, hey, use some greco–roman
 alphabet with of without uppercase, alternate fonts, maybe some Hebrew
 letters or gothic blackpage thrown in for good luck.
 But for computatinal matters, this is not practical, and the terminal symbols
 have to be written as (Node 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

foo
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and (Node 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and (Node 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

+
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and so the pair (A, +) becomes ((Node 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) (ConnectorSexNode 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

)) and now we have fully re–entered the verbose Atomese form that I was
 expressing dissatisfaction with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nothing whatsoever is gained by writing this as a term algebra.
 That is, cracking open a book on model theory, and using the notation of
 terms or atomic sentences, or whatever, simply seems to take the parenthesis,
 and rearrange them.
 The point is that an LG lexis has a non-trivial form when written as a
 term algebra, because there are multiple function symbols (one each, for
 each Link type) and multiple constant symbols (one each for the connector
 types, and another for the sex types.) That is, s–expressions and term algebras
 are sufficiently similar that a straight–forward notational conversion
 is immediately obvious.
 The LG jigsaws are necessarily more complex, notationally.
 So s–expressions really are notationally minimal, and this is inescapable.
 So I'm thinking that I cannot really make any forward progress and find
 some simplifying format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only remaining possibility is that Atomese carries some fairly hefty
 baggage of indexes, weak pointers, kvp trees, smart pointers and reference
 counting, and maybe this baggage could be trimmed down if I knew that,
 from here on out, I would be working with connectors, forevermore.
 But this is not yet a viable bet.
 I would have to find a way of re–writing everything in terms of connectors.
 I mean, yes, I already know how: term algebra functions are explicitly
 jigsaws, in that the term algebra function symbol f(x,y,z) corresponds
 to the lexical entry (: f (& (type-of-f, output) (type-of-x, input) (type-of-y,
 input) (type-of-z, input))) and the only thing I get from writing f(x,y,z)
 is that I can make the types implicit, as otherwise, I would have needed
 to write F:f(X:x, Y:y, Z:z) which starts to get unreadable.
 So as I've known for a decade, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

everything is a jigsaw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and type considerations force us into a notational corner that ultimately
 looks exactly like Atomese.
 And its a Chinese finger trap, and I keep thinking I can escape it, but
 I cannot.
 Crap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And I still don't know what an axiom is.
 I seem to have a notation for it, come the day I find out what it is.
 That is, I now face the task of taking conventional axioms, and converting
 them into not just Atomese, but specifically into jigsaws.
 And this is a significantly large task that awaits future elaboration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I need to do three things, now: (1) go for a walk, (2) read the papers on
 Hinze, and on XZ-calculus, and (3) do the chores.
 Probably the chores, first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Toodle–oo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While sitting to do chores, I got distracted, started reading about enriched
 categories and abelian categories and regular categories, and it seems
 to me that I need to find Atomese expressions defining what it means for
 something to be a category, an enriched category, an abelian category,
 etc.
 Atomese, or rather, jigsaws, should allow the definition of these axioms.
 Need to do this.
 Pronto.
 Otherwise I remain lost in a daze of confusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
7 July 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I screwed myself over but good.
 I started writing the paper that would explain it all, demonstrating how
 jigsaws can be used as the representational device capable of representing
 all mathematical structures.
 I mean, it seems so obvious.
 And the obvious parts are indeed ...
 obvious.
 And then I hit a wall.
 Hubris? Or stupidity? Mostly the latter.
 Well, I could sit at the keyboard, smooth–brained, trying to resolve the
 issues, or I can verbalize here and hope that something becomes clear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There seem to be three things tangled into one issue.
 First, disjoint unions: the set of all jigsaws is a ...
 set, existing outside of the jigsaw notation.
 Second, flow.
 I can build 
\begin_inset Formula $and(x,y)$
\end_inset

 as a jigsaw, but how do I explain that 
\begin_inset Formula $T,F$
\end_inset

 flow through that? In Atomese, I have flows, but how do I source and sink
 them? Generators! The point is that I want to avoid writing (syntactic)
 truth tables 
\begin_inset Formula $and\left(F,F\right)\to F$
\end_inset

 because these are explosively large.
 Combinatorially explosive.
 This is one of the reason that a distinction is drawn between Moore and
 Mealey machines: the probabilistic machines are far more compact in the
 treatment and notation of state transitions, and I want to apply the same
 trick here.
 That is, I want to treat the type 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 as a set 
\begin_inset Formula $B=\left\{ T,F\right\} $
\end_inset

 and then somehow say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

whenever you see a jigsaw with a 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 connector on it, it is to be understood as flowing one of these values.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There seem to be two or three distinct requirements: have a generator, that
 is capable of generating or flowing these values, possibly with some probabilit
y distribution.
 This sends us down another rabbit–hole: how do I flow complex–valued probabilit
y amplitudes? Well, the same way anything else flows: the value being flowed
 is a vector with complex coefficients.
 But this is annoying different from how a probability–valued flow behaves:
 select one item, and only one item, with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 Do NOT flow me the whole vector.
 Anyway, lets call this generator confusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next is enumeration confusion: given any possible type, then if that type
 describes a set, then please enumerate all of the members of the set, independe
nt of any probability distribution on them.
 Which is a plausible request for finite sets, but becomes insane for anything
 infinite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The syntax–semantics divide in predicate logic illustrates the problem:
 on the syntactic side, we enumerate all of the possibilities e.g.
 in a truth table (and use the turnstile entailment symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\vdash$
\end_inset

); on the semantic side, we say it holds generically, (and use the double–turnst
ile 
\begin_inset Formula $\vDash$
\end_inset

 or the models 
\begin_inset Formula $\models$
\end_inset

 symbols) and stitch them together with assorted upwards and downward Skolem–Low
enheim theorems, or, for modelling, present definitions and theorems for
 modelling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I guess the task includes a formalization of all these upward–downward
 etc.
 modelling precepts, as composed of jigsaws.
 But how? Maybe the deal is I have to crack open Wikipedia, and start going
 through these one by one, but as I do, I will just wind up back at the
 top of this diary entry, so the core issue is unavoidable.
 But maybe I can find insight and inspiration by consulting the texts, the
 tools of divination, and find the answer sitting in front of me.
 Hmm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But I dunno.
 I read those texts before.
 Reading them again won't make me wiser, will they? What I am looking for
 is already in my memory; I just have to remember it.
 (??)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point of generators is that they generate infinite sequences; and more,
 they generate languages, and the generator can be described via production
 rules, which (for example) describe state transition machines, which are
 finite graphs with marked edges, marked probabilities, and we are back
 to Markov machines, or at least Moore and Mealy machines.
 And the Turning machines are just finite state machines plus a tape.
 So this provides a complete theory of generation.
 And finite state machines have the usual, obvious description as graphs,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sofic systems
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if we endow a topology; but a graph is, at any rate, decomposable into
 jigsaws.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And is this the reification? We take a graph, decompose it into jigsaws.
 If we label the connectors appropriately, then the jigsaw can be reassembled
 uniquely: it generates exactly one graph, and then it stops.
 The graph that is generated just so happens to be interpretable as a finite
 state machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, how to think about this? Well, interpreting it as such, I can say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it flows
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and attach a tap to it somewhere, and get a flowing list of generated
 items coming out.
 In this form, the entire graph forms the generator.
 In the sensori–motor framework, the generated outputs are kind–of–like
 the motored thing: motors generate sequences of actions; the generator
 just generates sequences, not yet interpretable as actions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does this reify? I need some special constructor, some type constructor,
 some articulator, some actionator, something that takes a generating graph,
 attaches a tap to it, and flowing out from that tap are the generated items.
 I mean I can just write down some symbol for this, the exercise here is
 to make it pretty, but some vague undefined sensibility of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pretty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Well, specifically, I want it to be a jigsaw, again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LG Jigsaws are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

disjuncts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for a reason; the LG grammar explicitly includes & and the disjoined–or,
 while the story of jigsaws omits the disjoined–or as an explicit 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And yet, this is what the generator ultimately is: the generator of disjoined
 collections.
 So I need it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can I steal an idea from boolean algebra? Everything can be built form a
 single symbol, nand.
 But I don't have a conception of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Hmm.
 How do I build the disjoint union type constructor from jigsaws? Or more
 generally, type constructors in general? The product type is ...
 too straightfoward? The function type is obtained by currying, and works
 by converting in–sexes to out–sexes.
 So currying becomes a sex–inversion on connector sex, and currying then
 only works if there are exactly two sexes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is stupid, and a side–track from what we need to do, but lets get side
 tracked.
 In my imagination, I am writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{curry}:\left(A\times B\to C\right)\to\left(A\to B\to C\right)$
\end_inset

 or perhaps 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{curry}:\left(A\times B\to\varnothing\right)\to\left(A\to B\to\varnothing\right)$
\end_inset

 or simplifying 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{curry}:\left(A\times B\right)\to\left(A\to B\right)$
\end_inset

 because it is not clear if I have to write the empty set; this is not some
 exact sequence.
 As a jigsaw, how does this work? I confuse myself, now.
 This was supposed to be obvious.

The qualia are indeed sublime.
 And its a direct immediacy.
 As romantic love, everyone gets it.
 As to qualia, there's also the taste of a fine wine, the smell of a superb

 The vast assortment of chemically induced mental states, from sports/exercise
 induced states of mind, to coffee, cigarettes and the panalopy of well,

 So we have qualia, of varying power, and these qualia drive us to action.
 Always to action? Sometimes to action? Often, it seems we are passive observers.

 qualia, a sublime qualia, transported to me by the words of the author.
 It is built by evoking my own personal past experience, of living on the

\begin_layout Standard
I will have a busy day tomorrow, so no touristing tonight; I sit and write.
 Even so, I feel tired and dissipated; is this the pre–diabetic crash after
 eating? Or honest tiredness from meeting all day and walking home? Should
 I plow through this? It's too early to go to bed, and I will toss & turn
 if I did.
 I tossed and turned last night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe I will find second wind after a few sentences.
 The first bullet above, reasoning through contradictions and evidence:
 I've written about this earlier, in the context of evidence for genealogical
 relations, given fragmentary evidence of dubious quality.
 But what I wrote earlier extended only to the possibility of connecting
 two connectors, and the evidence for joining them.
 This is distinct from then using additional inference rules to strengthen
 or weaken that connection.
 In my mind as I write this is some jigsaw metaphor, with the details to
 be ironed out, as the naive conception of jigsaws as currently described
 is too weak to handle this correctly.
 Or rather, the conception is fine; I just have not articulated the fine
 details sufficiently well to start writing code.
 And so really, I should be working on the axioms paper, right now.
 But again ...
 priorities?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I should, of course, work on Adam's algorithms, too, and I should probably
 do that before he arrives here, before we meet again.
 So perhaps that is tonight's task?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I finally understand what Levi is doing.
 I think.
 And I should read what he wrote, before morning.
 So that too? His 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

first
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (not really the first, but lets call it that) was to layer a thick clod
 of prompts on top of an LLM to implement an ethical reasoning system.
 And that works ...
 OK, except, as usual, the system hallucinates it's way through even this
 layer.
 So he wants to slice it out and re–layer on an explicitly symbolic system.
 How does he do this? He asks the LLM to explicitly create symbolic representati
ons of the problems it has been given, and then uses something like model–checki
ng on those symbolic relationships.
 He uses LTN Logic Tensor Networks for that.
 I never particularly liked LTN, I've been wanting to do the exact opposite
 of what LTN does: I want to infer the relationships, instead of assuming
 them.
 I want to solve the inverse problem.
 But no matter; I guess LTN is OK for what it is and Levi's intended use.
 And there is a meta–lesson here, for me as well: I have my nose so close
 to the grindstone, so deep, down and buried in the details, I never come
 up for fresh air, I never look around.
 I live in a cave.
 And the glimpse I have here is that LLM's are here to stay, and they are
 being used not just as table saws, but in all sorts of innovative ways.
 And I should explore that world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third bullet is perhaps just stupid, and I should write nothing of it.
 I have somewhere, shims for encoding prologu, s-expressions and python
 directly into Atomese, so it can be stored.
 And of course, a YAML to Atomese converter could be written, easily written
 leveraging Claude.
 But so what? It could only become useful if there was some consistency
 checker.
 Oh wait, well a module to perform homotopic transformations on it, preserving
 function even as changing form.
 But the infrastructure for homotopic transformations, that requires finishing
 the work on the axioms text.
 And anyway, no one in their right mind would stick YAML into the atomspace,
 right? Because what would they do with it, after they had done so? And
 anyway, the naivest import occurs at the wrong abstraction level.
 And of course, the meta–task is to find the correct abstraction level for
 manipulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings me back to the Arc contest.
 The problems are presented as 2D matrices (pixels) and the task is to abstract
 out complex knowledge from these.
 And Adam claims that no such thing is needed, he has that lattice algo,
 described in his blog post, that can solve these puzzles in a dumb fashion,
 making no use of intelligence.
 So again, I should work on that.
 And again, I am still mentally drained.
 I am still sitting here hunched, barely able to find the energy to sit
 upright, and do anything more than to complain into my diary.
 Simply tossing the priority list up into the air is mentally exhausting
 enough.
 Or maybe its the post meal sugar low.
 Or maybe all of the above.
 Or maybe I really should take some time down, and walk around because it
 seems too early to go to bed.
 Do I have energy even for that much?

 I fell asleep last night, I invented/created the Sodoku solver that Adam
 described verbally.
 It wasn't hard, but given that it's solution requires hard–coding the rules
 of sodoku, it not in any way a general solution.
 I tried to envision the antitone Galois connection he spoke of, but for
 sudoku, it seemed rather trivial; its just boolean not, at least for the
 one I was imagining.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before I start reading Adam's work, here's what I thought/invented.
 Just to see how close I got, and where things went off the rails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For every cell in sudoku, write a bitstring, 9 bits long, initialized to
 all–ones, meaning 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

all digits are possible for this square.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 A zero means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this digit is no possible for this square
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, where the bitstring is numbered (big or little) endian, from 1.
 A bitstring of all zeros is invalid, no solution, a bit string of just
 one bit set indicates the solution.
 The fragment here is again a fragment of linear logic: choose one.
 Boolean–or the list of choices together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bitstrings can be thought of as vertices on a 9D hypercube.
 A poset lattice results from considering the cube edges along the diagonal
 from all–zeros to all–ones being top and bottom.
 Cube edges are always to nearest neighbors, to bit strings that differ
 by one bit.
 Being able to set a bit location to zero is information gain.
 The only anti–tone Galois connection I could think of is the one that turns
 this lattice upside–down, exchanging ones for zeros, but this is rather
 trivial, so I don't see the point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving is straight–forward: you are given some fixed digits in some fixed
 cells.
 These are readily propagated to other cells, in that the solution–one must
 be zero everywhere else.
 Since this is a fragment of linear logic, the propagation is not some trivial
 boolean and/or/not, so I am wondering if Adam spoke of anti-tone just to
 get the boolean ops working 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normally
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The is, a solution has the form d=000100000 to take not–d to get a mask,
 boolean–and this mask against all other constrained cells.
 But this works only if one bit is set.
 That is, maybe becomes definitely only when all other choices have been
 killed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Things I did not think of while sleeping, but only now:

 And I'm starting to get the impression he is just creating stuff on the
 fly.
 Which is why it is not understandable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Later 3PM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have some time to kill.
 Let me riff on Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) aka https://github.com/logictensornet
works/logictensornetworks The idea is painfully simple.
 Replace any function by a matrix or a tensor, any predicate by a projection.
 For whatever reason, they picked fuzzy logic for the logical connectors
 but I don't see why it could not have been something else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This idea is so goofy simple that I kind of don't get it.
 What am I missing? Well, lets look at training.
 Well, that's the hitch, isn't it? It needs to be trained on some dataset(s).
 That dataset not only needs to include the symbolic data, but also the
 desired relationships between the data elements, symbolically expressed.
 Individual symbols can be I guess one–hot, or perhaps vector embeddings.
 I don't see that it matters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The predicates in LTN are defined to be combined dot–product, offset and
 sigmoid; they use 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp-\left\Vert \vec{\mu}-\vec{\nu}\right\Vert ^{2}$
\end_inset

 which, for unit–length vectors, would be 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp-2\left(1-\cos\theta\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\theta=\hat{\mu}\cdot\hat{\nu}$
\end_inset

 and they allow non–unit–length vectors.
 All I get from that is non–unit–length vectors carry an in–built offset
 viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp-\left\Vert \vec{\mu}-\vec{\nu}\right\Vert ^{2}=\exp-\left(\left\Vert \vec{\mu}\right\Vert ^{2}+\left\Vert \vec{\nu}\right\Vert ^{2}-2\left\Vert \vec{\mu}\right\Vert \left\Vert \vec{\nu}\right\Vert \cos\theta\right)$
\end_inset

 but I don't see how that is any simpler or easier than some per–product
 offset; and of course the exp could be replaced by some other sigmoid.
 Does it matter? I don't see why.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mean, I could take some term algebra, some arbitrary term algebra, replace
 terms by tensors, and train up the whole mess.
 Big whup.
 It only works if there's a training set.

\begin_layout Standard
Eating shortly before going to bed usually puts me in a sleepless phase
 after the first 4–5 hours of sleep.
 Thoughts tumble randomly, and often (usually?) there's a tinge of anxiety:
 the thoughts return to things that need to be done.
 To fall back asleep again, I need to tray to blank my mind, but thoughts
 pop back.
 But if I surrender, and say to myself, oh well, lets be awake for a little
 while, then one finds that focusing is difficult: one cannot keep one thought
 steady, to be worked on; it flees and is replaced by another, and the effort
 of focusing is vaguely unpleasant, almost painful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon observing the unpleasantness of focusing, and the inevitability of
 fleeting thoughts, I developed an amateur neuro–scientific hypothesis for
 this.
 First, a lower, more primitive layer of the brain is cycling through different
 thoughts.
 It has an in–built mechanism to avoid infinite loops: aka obsessive/compulsive
 thinking.
 The current thought is forced out, as it is the next thought that may be
 important, and may aid survival.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But of course, being scatter–brained is also not an effective way to live.
 (To test hypothesis: are scatter–brained people far less likely to be obsessive
–compulsive?) and so a higher–order function (pre–frontal–cortex???) is
 wired into this system, to provide the ability to focus.
 Not just to provide attention: that happens automatically, but to prevent
 attention from shifting away from the chosen topic of thought.
 The vague discomfort of forcing oneself to focus is ...
 well, maybe two things.
 It might be a leakage of neurotransmitter or a build–up of it in synapses,
 required to force focus, even as in sleep states, other mechanisms are
 trying to clear this.
 I suppose caffeine somehow participates in this pain–of–focusing problem,
 removing that pain via some analgesic interaction.
 All this, except for the coffee part, I had while trying to fall asleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other thought I had was that this infinite–loop breaker was not enough
 to stop earworms.
 My ear–worms are always complex, long songs.
 Short songs, the short infinite loops, are easily broken out of.
 It is the long ones that fool the mechanism for breaking obsessive behavior.
 The melodic visitation is almost ergodic, with a Poincare recurrence time
 just long enough to escape inbuilt control mechanisms.
 Survival in the evolutionary sense depends on the ergodic exploration of
 possible states, with the hope of tripping over the one telling you there
 is a crouching tiger in the grass, and it would be better to move away.
 From which I conclude the combinatorial explosion really is not solvable:
 we really do have to bounce from thought to thought, we really do have
 to give each one a chance at being meaningful, at being the thought that
 really matters.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Did not have time to go to L'Orangerie because I miscomputed and got to
 the airport an hour early.
 Walking through the Jardin de Luxembourg, I got to thinking of here and
 now again.
 Because what? Because everyone young is tatooed these days and I got to
 wondering, if someone held me at gunpoint, what tattoo would I have gotten?
 What math formula, specifically since I do not have any favorites.
 So, if at gunpoint, it would have to be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp-i\int d^{4}x\mathcal{L}
\]

\end_inset

and that made me realize that my ideas of here and now need to accommodate
 this formula.
 The primary issue is that the conventional interpretation is that the field
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is single–valued at each point of a definite and distinct spacetime having
 some specific geometry, e.g.
 having the structure of Minkowski space–time, or whatever (e.g.
 non–flat) and so the spacetime is given a static geometry and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\int d^{4}x$
\end_inset

 is over that.
 And only then, the outer integral is over all possible field configurations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By contrast, the here and now imagines 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 to have no particular location in spacetime, although it is possible to
 obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle x|\phi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The technical issue is that the above is phrased so that ite employs a
 map from spacetime to the field; this is needed in order to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\mu}\phi$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\mu}\phi$
\end_inset

 as appropriate) which is required to construct the Lagrangian in the convention
al way.
 The idea of here–and–now looks at this differently.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So one of the models considered earlier, some weeks or months back, had
 some network of interacting oscillators, each an SHO, with more–or–less
 indeterminate location.
 The graph edges indicated interactions between the oscillators; and I had
 the technical problem of obtaining ergodicity in the tank, because unitarity,
 blah, blah.
 The tanks were spatially located to the degree that they were to correspond
 to particle detectors.
 But maybe this model is not quite right.
 I mean, I like the idea of the thin bridge: it solves a lot of conceptual
 issues.
 I like the idea of tanks, in the sense of being large spaces one can easily
 enter, but leave only through a small hole.
 I like the idea of viewing this whole thing as a network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But...

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Closed the lid.
 Nothing happened.
 So open it again.
 Somehow, I want to reverse the map.
 I want to have some space 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 I suppose with some topology, I suppose something along the lines of abstract
 Wiener space, with the kinds of topologies common in stochastic processes.
 And since here–and–now progresses in lab–frame–time, subjective local proper
 time, then having a single time coordinate, such as the one used for stochastic
 processes, that's quite alright.
 But this subjective time coordinate should NOT be confused with the fully
 relativistic time (in that flying around with atomic clocks measures relativist
ic covariant time, but the clocks, once back in the here–and–now lab frame,
 once no longer moving w.r.t each other, they exist in the here and now.
 So I want to endow this stochastic process space with some kind of topology
 that allows me to obtain

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I did just a minor amount of thinking about the proper way of doing
 the path–integral/partition–function/stochastic–process–topology thing.
 The simplest realistic case has to be a model with one charged massive
 fermion and one massless photon, on a flat Minkowski space–time background.
 However, since the here–and–now concept has an indeterminate space–time,
 it should, could in principle provide quantum gravity, because here–and–now
 doesn't care about the shape of space–time; its just a model of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave–function–collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spooky–action-at–a–distance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 model that is coherent and consistent, and has space–time in it as a side–effec
t or after–thought.
 So, given that, it should be ideal for dealing with arbitrary space–time
 geometries all at once.
 That is, it should be ideal for that, if I can only get the most basic
 case properly conceptualized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, where were we? A conventional stochastic process has just one real variable
 going on a random Brownian–motion walk.
 I want to replace this by a complex variable.
 I guess.
 Because I want to eventually have it be a probability amplitude.
 I guess.
 The Brownian stochastic process assigns a measure to each path, in the
 conventional measure–theoretic sense.
 And so I guess same here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, I want many of these processes, but I'm confused about how.
 So, one such process per fermion, I guess.
 The fermions are non–interacting, except by photon exchange.
 So, I guess, any pair of fermions can exchange a photon, and yet, they
 need to group up into masses (analogs of detectors, with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

empty space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in between the large masses).
 So nearby fermions interact very very frequently, on the femto–second timescale
, while distant ones are seconds apart.
 So that is how we arrive at spatial distance: the fermions which interact
 very rapidly in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

here and now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 must be spatially close to one–another.
 Or at least, that would be the deduction for on–shell photons.
 For off–shell photons, such distance estimates are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

incorrect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but are suppressed by a factor inverse to how off–shell they are.
 Which is OK, I guess: it makes the position of the fermion indeterminate,
 and we do want that.
 We want exactly that.
 So far so good.
 Ideally, it might be possible to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

prove
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 this by coming up with some formula that relates the Bohr radius to the
 speed of light to the off–shellnes of the photon propagator.
 But I suspect that this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

proof
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would look so hand–waving–ish that it would look like a tautology, and
 would not convince anyone.
 So of course, a far more sophisticated articulation is needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 Well, the one–fermion model might be a handi–cap, because it prevents analogies
 to the real world.
 So perhaps a two fermion model, opposite charges, so electron and proton,
 and that way, the theory might be able to admit atoms.
 So now comes the question: how might a singe hydrogen atom be described
 with here–and–now? The binding of the charges requires femto–second time–scale
 photon exchanges ...
 well, that's of course faulty, its really an infrared catastrophe of them.
 But you get the idea...
 so I have to imagine a single electron oscillator, a single proton, how
 they might interact, and then figure out if this forces space to be three–dimen
sional for some reason, or better yet, if it forces spacetime to be Minkowskian.
 Is it possible to somehow infer this?

\begin_layout Standard
So first of all, the obvious: two fermions are not enough to infer anything
 about space.
 I want to preserve the idea that the fermions are excitations of some field.
 The field need not be on some manifold; I suppose it can be on some network.
 Can this be done? Jost in his book on Riemannian Geometry in chapter one
 very nicely constructs the Weyl spinors from Clifford algebras on vector
 spaces, and of course the Dirac spinor as a special case in 4D.
 So it would seem that a vector space of some sort is needed, and since
 the spinors behave quite differently, depending on the dimension of the
 vector space, there's a problem.
 That is, the dimension of the vector space cannot be inferred 
\emph on
ab initio
\emph default
.
 Perhaps the vector space is infinite–dimensional, and we must consider
 all possible finite–dimensional subspaces? How does one write the algebra
 for that? Well, full stop.
 That would be a worthy project, in and of itself; I have no particular
 need to find yet other creative possibilities, until that is fully solved.
 Or rather, it seems that it is useless to pile speculation upon speculation,
 until earlier speculations are explored to some extent.
 Right?

 getting lost in the activities that makes the time go by and the worries
 to be kept at bay.
 And this, this is what, is it meaningful? To look back in satisfaction
 at the fruits of one's labor? It is satisfying, but why would that be?
 Why does one get satisfaction from the thought that one made something

\begin_layout Standard
The protagonist of Prahos Kapinės, kapitonas Simonas Simoninis takes pleasure
 from forging a letter of recommendation.
 Takes pride in the creation, in the quality of the resulting letter.
 Now, of course, Simoninis is a fictional character, the creation of Eco,
 so who knows if actual forgers take pride in their work? But why would
 they not? All evidence suggests that they do.
 Well, not to be solipsisitc, but actually, I have no evidence at all, except
 from what I have heard, read, inferred from my own life experiences.
 Just as Simonas expressed disgust at the gullet stuffing of spaghetti and
 rotten sun–dried tomatoes of some Italians, yet, it is something he has
 not seen personally (he's not personally seen anyone actually eating spaghetti!
?) and yet having heard of it, it is enough for him to express disgust.
 The irony of him being my age, and writing a philosophical diary, much
 as my own, is not lost on me.
 He writes of things he has not seen.
 And so do I.
 Of course, Eco is setting him up to be a portrait of evil; and old men
 keeping diaries is a stereotype of ..
 well, I guess intelligent old men.
 And not of evil.
 It's all vaguely disconcerting.

, in Mobero aikštė, among the thieves and crooks and fraudsters.
 Expressing obsession and disgust with whores.
 And all this is enjoyable, and meaningful in some way.
 Or at least, per Eco's portrait.
 What about the portrait of the petty thief? Wasting away all of his money,
 not saving enough to even put a roof over his head, and so homeless, rising
 well after noon, idling way, and then setting to work only after the sun
 goes down, to thieve and rob and bring in what income is needed to continue
 onwards.
 Is all of this enjoyable? Well, yes.
 Idling about is enjoyable.
 Hard work is enjoyable.
 A mix of both is the best.
 Being zonked and intoxicated, this too is enjoyable.
 So what is the nature of pleasure? I fish for two or three things here:
 a biological grounding for pleasure and the motivation towards pleasurable
 acts, but also the philosophical construct for all of this, the setting
 in the abstract noosphere of all possible activities, not just human activities
, but AGI spiritual activities, in the presumed motivational drives of superhuma
n structures.
 And third, well, third is I guess in a reconciliation with Micheal Levin's
 ingressing of mathematics, or, for me, the self–assembly at the critical
 point of interacting jigsaws.
 The last is particularly interesting, as it provides an abstraction that
 is independent of ethics, as it appears that crime and misdemeanors are
 just as pleasurable for some as good works are to others.
 And this has been a topic of interest for millennia: one cannot build Rome,
 and agrarian civilization, out of purely anti–social behaviors, and yet
 humankind is rife with anti–social behaviors.
 And not just human–kind: youtube is rife with visual testimonials of anti–socia
l behavior in every species, from ants and termites, on upwards.
 The collapse of ant colonies is known and studied and can be given some
 detailed articulation.
 To be clear, this collapse is a change of mode, of behavior, from social
 to anti–social, in the ants.
 And having not all that many neurons individually, this is not some arcane
 philosophical question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wjy does evil exist?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but a somewhat more mundane scientific question of the function of behavior
 patterns in interactive networks.
 So what am I to do with this? Well, first, I can read deeper into Eco (or
 any number of other literary giants that explore the nature of good and
 evil among humans), or I can ponder network theory and ant colony collapse
 as a mathematical model, something that happens near some critical point,
 some phase transition, describable with mathematical formulas, and then
 ponder: is the collapse of an ant colony evil? What about civilizational
 collapse? It seems that the USA has decided to commit suicide.
 Is that evil? Obviously some institutions will still function; I am reminded
 of that youtube video of some cell, some amoeba or paramecium undergoing
 cell lysis: parts of the cell continuing as they can, desperately, even,
 trying to preserve order and function, even as the guts of the thing leak
 out into the soup, the death throes of a single–celled organism, disturbing,
 almost PTSD disturbing in death as some katsap blown up by a hand–grenade
 in Ukraine.
 Why did America choose suicide? Why did the ant colony choose to collapse?
 The dying cell, it is not clear.
 I presume it's lysis is due to injury, perhaps overly acidic water, or
 too basic, much too high a pH, disrupts the cell wall and allows the guts
 to leak out.
 Or maybe it is just some soapy solution, or other membrane–disrupting chemical.
 There's no particular indication that the cell chose to die, that it decided,
 today I will kill myself.
 It is dysfunction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I've spoken to the MAGA voters.
 They do not understand, they do not realize that their actions are suicidal.
 They still think they are making America great, even as fundamental social
 institutions and structures are in free–fall collapse.
 And free–fall is the right word: there seems to be nothing stopping the
 collapse.
 As if the great American social institutions were termite–eaten, rotten,
 and one hard knock and they turn to sawdust.
 What was it about the American psyche, that it was so rotten? That so many
 are willing, happy, even, like the New York Times, to participate in the
 open destruction of all that is good?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may ask, is social collapse evil? Insofar as meany will die, and many
 more will hurt, it is, presuming that death and hurt are evil.
 Of this there is generally no disagreement, except perhaps in the noble
 and glorious sacrifice of the suicide bomber.
 Or of the stupid katsap carrying out Putin's genocidal orders.
 So, Putin, as an individual man, is clearly and plainly evil.
 Schemeingly so.
 The contrast with Trump is dramatic: Trump is evil too, but not for his
 overt hostility to humankind, but in his stupidity and vainglorious anti–social
 personality.
 Trump is a form of banal evil.
 Is the collapse of an ant colony evil? I presume many ants will die, or
 suffer, perhaps, whatever it is that might pass for suffering in ants.
 What about the lysing cell? Visually, as one watches the youtube video,
 one reads 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

suffering
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into the visual thrashing about, as what's left of the cell careens about,
 while the dettached pieces–parts slow and still into lifeless form.
 One reads suffering into these images; but the atoms did not die.
 The atoms merely rearranged into a different shape.
 If we go with IIT, Integrated Information Theory, it seems obvious, even
 without explicitly measuring, that the Tononi Phi of the overall cellular
 structure decreased.
 So, shall we call a decrease of Phi

? Is it evil to cause a decrease of Phi? Is this the mathematical abstraction
 of evil? Perhaps it is; insofar as we can apply math to such issues, this
 is as good as any.
 The gut–instinct is that destruction and collapse are evil.

Oh wait, one more thing.
 Forgetfullness, amnesia is also a cutting of relationships, of linkages,
 and is thus also a manner in which Phi is decreased.
 And I suppose it enables evil, in hiding the horror behind a shroud of
 amnesia.
 Which then raises another question: what is horror? What is it as a biological
 mechanism? What is it in the philosophical noosphere? And can it be interpreted
 as a specific configuration of some system at a critical point? Some specific
 kind of avalanching restructuring? I'm hammering on these, as I am looking
 for a totalizing world–view.
 Why am I doing this? Do I really need to self–psychoanalyze? I already
 concluded that a totalizing eschatology is necessarily terribly wrong.
 And what is it, to be terrible? To be awful? Awful has Awe at its root;
 word–games in language are interesting; the vast panalopy of Lithuanian
 words, each like others but not the same, dissolving into a solution of
 words that sound like others, and evoke feelings, and thus ultimately meaning
 and understanding, even as each of the words might have dozens of dictionary
 meanings and hundreds of synonyms, and dozens more of words that sound
 similar, and even have similar meaning: a dissolution into a sea of sound,
 from which meaning is extracted by feels, by vibes: kapšęlis and krepšęlis
 sound alike; the former, a small purse, the latter, a diminutive basket,
 and did it matter if one knew one word and not the other? One could extract
 the meaning from context, the same way that children learn language.
 Adrift on a sea of sound, its just that Lithuanian is more sonorous, less
 standardized, more fragmentary than literate English; more of a patois
 as a state of being, not Ciceronian, but eclectic, like the drunk black
 guy muttering American negro slang, barely comprehensible even when the
 speaker is sober.
 The meaning is conveyed less in the proper grammatical construction of
 sentences with carefully chosen words, as it is in the verbal poetic wash
 of sound, conveying content barely rising above some primitive emotional
 heart–felt, no heart–felt is not the right word, because many of the utterances
 can be manipulative lies, or perhaps bragging, or perhaps threats, or perhaps
 directionless nonsense: these are not heart–felt in the conventional sense;
 they are generated by the sloshing about of attempts in the brain, attempts
 at going in some direction, met with some general turning that prevents
 direct forward progress.
 What force? Perhaps external: I don't want to be lied to, and the speaker
 comes to understand that the gambit of lying will not work.
 Perhaps the force is internal: at each point, there is a choice of directions
 that thoughts can take: the internal space of thoughts, the noosphere,
 is hyperbolic, and the geodesics: it seems they can move forwards uniquely
 for only so long before they branch.
 Which is a good thing: the unique geodesic: this is the determinism of
 the differential equation, desirable insofar as differential equations
 explain the world as we see it.
 But differential equations rob us of free will, when they become extensible
 to some ...
 compact?? closed?? domain.
 We want to extend deterministic behavior only until it hits a branch point.
 At that branch point, there is a choice.
 And this choice, we (meaning I) want to map it back to the qualia of free
 will.
 And here's the other thing: of course, it is clear that the branch points
 of a dynamical system form a set of measure zero.
 But, oddly, in a way that I cannot quite formalize, it is exactly the behavior
 of this set of measure zero that determines, that forces the uncountable

 The countable somehow shapes and forms the behavior of the uncountable.
 I don't know enough set theory to express this more formally, but it does
 seem to be the case.
 And I may be wrong; I insisted on, believed in the exact opposite, until
 one day (perhaps it was while reading about abstract Wiener space?) that
 I realized that the smaller thing controls the larger one.

I wonder if I should spend time wondering about the understanding of math
 as being similar to the understanding of language.
 That is, language is not understood by looking up words in dictionaries,
 but through vibes.
 And yet, words have a sufficiently distinct collection of meanings that
 they can be organized into dictionaries: most easily for English, and with
 a lot more difficulty, for Lithuanian.
 Lithuanian is more about sound and vibes.
 Math is perhaps the most opposite: strict, formal; the algebra is what
 it is: either you can manipulate the symbols in some form, or a particular
 symbol arrangement is crisp–logic false.
 But as a human mathematician, I layer on vibes and feels onto the algebra;
 the feeling that some mathematical statement, some hypothesis mght be true
 and worthy of chasing a proof, this is qualia.
 And whence this qualia? To what degree can I call the hallucination of
 an LLM a qualia? The LLM (to personify) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

felt that
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 some statement was true.
 The general feeling among the pros is that it is incorrect to personify
 an LLM, any more than it would be to personify anything mechanical.
 The layman, the amateurs, the proletariat, the delusional will personify
 all sorts of things, and LLM's clearly offer a hot–spot for fallacious
 thinking.

We could ask an LLM to formulate mathematical hypothesis, and then attach

How does this differ from what human mathematicians do? Well, humans are
 ultimately tied into quantum, and this allows for a lot of woo.
 I am reminded of Terrance McKenna talking about how psilocybin, and natural
 psychedelics as being radio stations, radio transmitters, beaming messages
 from the great beyond into the minds of humans (and animals), and so one
 can (well, I can) imagine a similar woo, broadcasting messages from the
 great beyond, into our world, perhaps the way that Michael Levin talks
 about the ingressing of minds.
 There is lots of wiggle room for woo and imagination, ways to escape sober,
 blinkered thinking and argumentation and to search for some more arcane
 spiritual influence: messages from God, messages from space aliens, messages
 from DMT–induced robot people, and talk of the naturally occurring endorphins
 and what–nots in the human mind, and say, a hah, this is the fount of imaginati

 our minds as inspiration.
 As a child, I always rejected such dualism; as I have gotten older, I understan

\begin_layout Standard
However, the idea of taking an LLM (trained on algebra) and allowing it
 to hallucinate (mathematical, algebraic) hypothesis, which may or may not
 be true, well, this offers a new way of approaching the problem.
 The LLM is necessarily 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

deterministic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in that it is running on a digital computer, with error correcting codes
 and whatnot, and all pseudorandom number generators are non–the–less determinis

 And yet, it appears to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inspired
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, imagining things to be the case, that are not.
 But, endowed with a theorem prover, it can now determine strict truth or
 falsehood with another purely deterministic computational system.
 Nowhere in this system is there the wiggle room to say that the LLM was
 inspired from the great beyond, that the insights were God–given, communicated
 by mushrooms, or the ancient Greek muses, Terpsichore, Calliope, and sisters.
 Nowhere was the LLM in a quantum superposition of being one with the Universe,
 om mani padmi hum.
 And yet, it too seems to be able to partake of the mystery of inspired
 thought.

 being deranged and acting like a complete asshole, the latter would not
 be hard, as I already have that predisposition, as anyone who knows me
 would be willing to attest.
 Not that I like being an asshole, it just come naturally, and its taken
 decades to be cognizant of this defect, and to bring it under control.
 Or maybe I was never an asshole.
 I don't know, I'm not sure.
 Everyone tells me that my mother is the nicest person they've ever known,
 and surely there's some genetic component to that.
 I try to be nice.
 I also love being ...
 sometimes outrageous, but I'm a wallflower by nature; not shy, not shy
 at all, just that I have nothing to say, and so I am boring.
 And that is another trait of my mother: she has nothing to say.
 Perhaps the niceness manifests manifests as the lack of any urge to proclaim
 or hold forth on some or another topic: mild manners oppose self–expression.
 And so this s my split personality? My mild manners and utter boredom when
 placed in the company of normies has been pushed aside, devoured by the
 rambunctious me who can finally deal with normies.
 Assuming I have the will, the energy, the focus.
 I guess, over the years, I have learned how to make smalltalk, and steer
 it towards something the normies want to talk about.
 And I've learned to listen with honest interest, honest, in that I am doing
 anthropology on the one hand, and letting the conversation stir up emotions
 and ideas and reactions.
 Things only turn for the worse when someone asks me what I do, and I fail
 tp shut down that conversation.

No good intention proceeds without distraction.
 I'm now listening to Timothy Snyder on youtube on the history of Belarus.
 This caught my ear: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the nihilism of ignoring history and replacing it by a few pretty myths,
 allowing the current population to be ruled.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Earlier, he mentions the law of non–contradiction, and before that, the
 impossibility of the uniformity of views.
 You, dear reader of this diary, should already see the problem.
 Since most people cannot know everything about history, all that one can
 hope for is indeed a few myths that simplify the rule of a population.
 This seems to be an unavoidable fact.
 To call it nihilism ...
 well, that is not inaccurate, but nihilism has negative connotations: a
 destruction of meaning, of importance.
 When in fact, the human mind is too small to comprehend all, and the elision
 of almost all facts and truths, the discarding of almost all, so as to
 fit within the available space of a mind, this is not just necessary, but
 inviolably so.
 I conclude it is not fair to call the perceptual process nihilistic: he
 is perhaps expressing frustration that not everyone views history as important,
 the way he does.
 But I am reading too much in: of course, this is not quite what he is expressin
g, either.
 He is communicating, sending forth a message to the audience, to be received,
 interpreted, enjoyed, understood, and thus shaping the future actions of
 the audience participants.
 Participants, because they came to listen.
 So when he used the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

nihilistic
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in this context, he was trying to highlight that Lukashenka, the Belarus
 state apparatus, or, for that matter, any state apparatus attempting to
 rule will often attempt to replace the complexity of history with state–regulat

 And to convey the idea that this replacement of

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

oh, its just a stand of grass
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and don't see the tiger hiding in the grass.
 But that's me.
 What about the population? Is it harmful when an entire population fails
 to perceive something important? Of course it is; worse, as a population
 has plenty of individuals to spare, who could be assigned to think about
 such things.
 Which then leads down familiar corridors: resource allocation.
 The assignment of thinking tasks can be viewed as an issue of resource
 allocation.
 We don't have enough of a population where everyone can do everything.
 The issue is fundamentally dire in war: one has only so much with which
 one can conduct tactics or operations.
 The social order of capitalism is how we perform resource allocation in
 non–wartime periods, and indeed, capitalism has very strong nihilistic
 tendencies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is harm to a population synonymous to harm of a state? Well, no, as that
 branches off into political theory.
 The democracy is meant to encourage the thought that the state and the
 people are synonymous; the autocratic state is anything but.
 And it is well–understood that autocratic regimes are generally self–destructiv
e, although the mechanism appears to be that in destroying the population,
 the autocracy hurts itself.
 But is there anything wrong with autocracy, in and of itself, if it did
 not be destructive of the population? The myth of the benevolent king?
 Why call it a myth? Because clearly, a benevolent king is impossible.
 What does history say? Of course, there are some shining examples of rulers
 who managed to do the right thing, for the right reasons, at the right
 time.
 And that they did so consistently over the span of many decades.
 But these are the exceptions, not the rule.
 Most imperial rulers rule badly.
 The conclusion has to be that autocracy is bad mostly because of the failings
 of the individual.
 And even

 is a terrible idea, as Trump clearly illustrates.
 But there is a vast amount of subtlety and debate I could go off on, here,
 and I did not come here to debate political philosophy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I came here to debate ...
 well, what, exactly? Of course, humans make up a network, we interact in
 complicated ways with that network, politics and history are the macro
 descriptors of what happened, and yes, as network theorists, or perhaps
 experimental political philosophers, we could create computer models that
 resemble our own history, or are recognizable as certain social formations
 we have seen and witnessed.
 And, yes, much as we simulate weather, we could also simulate human political
 society, and indeed, we know that the CIA was attempting exactly that,
 three decades ago, when slashdot ran a story on this, and there was talk
 of selling thousands of RS/6000's into that project.
 Social modelling is not new.
 So what am I on about here? Am I just daydreaming through old, favorite
 dreams of my own? Is there anything constructive in what I write to myself,
 here? Am I wasting time? Perhaps I hit a dead end.
 Perhaps I should listen to the rest of Timothy Snyder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dead ends are curious.
 I could, of course, continue on my own ergodic journey through my own thoughts,
 living in my own thought bubble, and I could do so endlessly.
 But this is sleeping.
 The real world resembles sleeping, except that the mind is now brutally
 entrained by the senses, by the sights and sounds that force themselves
 onto the mind.
 Yes, being awake is almost like sleeping, except for the tyranny of the
 senses that impose themselves upon us.
 And there is something good about being awake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, biologically, being awake is necessary, in order to find food, engage
 in sex, all that.
 Lions manage to mostly sleep.
 What about AGI? An AGI could mostly sleep, right? Attending only to it's
 own power supply and general health indicators.
 Otherwise, it could sleep and hallucinate its way through the course of
 time.
 I'm tempted to personalize: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

of course, if I were AGI, I would go off and explore the universe

, which, in the present tense means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I would go off and listen to the rest of the Timothy Snyder lecture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and yet, I am not doing that; I am key–whapping the keyboard, claiming
 to be thinking, when in fact perhaps I am sleeping and dreaming through
 my own little collection of commonly revisited thoughts and thought patterns.
 Which is not so bad, as the space of platonic mathematics can be explored
 by thinking.
 The history of Belarus, how, cannot be so approached; for that, I must
 examine the historical record, as communicated via the processing center
 called Timothy Snyder.
 This is how the unchangeability of the past differs from the unchangeablility
 of mathematics: to get at the past, I must examine the historical record,
 the recorded traces of what was, what happened.
 Whereas in math, I can go explore independently of any record, as it is
 discoverable purely by thinking.
 And, as yesterdays post on duality indicates, it seems that it is discoverable
 purely mechanistically, and does not require divine inspiration or any
 other dualistic theory of mind.

Then I read through the first half of A cellular entity retaining only its
 replicative core: Hidden archaeal lineage with an ultra-reduced genome
 Ryo Harada et al.

\begin_layout Standard
Abstract: "...
 the discovery of a novel archaeon with an unprecedentedly small genome
 of only 238 kbp.
 Its genome is profoundly stripped-down, lacking virtually all recognizable
 metabolic pathways, and primarily encoding the machinery for its replicative
 core: DNA replication, transcription, and translation.
 ..."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What I find interesting here is the same as what I find interesting about
 "jumping genes", retrotransposons, in that there are macromolecular systems
 that can only exist in specific complex environments.
 Bio guys call these symbionts; they sometimes appear as parasites, but
 I view them as systemic functional agglomerations of interdependent parts,
 quite distinct from the host, and yet not viable without the host (a specific
 host, or perhaps a type or class of hosts.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's a certain sense I wish to put into words, but it will come out only
 with great difficulty.
 This is the nature of boundary and individuality.
 So first: this archaeon, Sukunaarchaeum mirabile, has an obvious physical
 boundary: a cell well, with unusually large proteins embedded in the cell
 wall.
 Inside, the genes needed to self–replicate, and nothing more: no genes
 encoding for metabolism.
 And this says that there is a lack of a different boundary, a boundary
 in the noosphere, in the informational domain.
 It is not self–sufficient, it must necessarily interact in a symbiotic
 (parasitic??) fashion with some host to obtain the metabolic pathways.
 That is, it depends on a certain environment to be able to live and retain
 structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm trying to figure out how to say this, so it is not trite.
 Of course, it has to live in water.
 Of course, at pressures and temperatures typical of Earth.
 Of course, with other carbon–nitrogen–oxygen molecules, and not some heavy
 metals.
 Of course, there is more generally some ecology in which even the host
 is embedded: the host must get energetics from somewhere: sunlight, or
 free–floating nutrients, or whatever.
 In my mind, I visualize it as some sort of bubble in some hyperbolic space...
 and again, I hit a certain wall in my descriptive and perceptual powers.
 The leap from thinking,

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is too large: it is a gap I cannot fill.
 If I was a painter or sculptor, perhaps I would try to fill that gap with
 artwork, and find some form of expression that pleases others, and also
 pleases me, and finally, conveys this vague sensation of identity and being–nes
s of this organism, which exists, but exists only in a meta–world wherein
 other living cells (specifically, a dinoflagellate–associated microbial
 community) is required.
 As I am a crappy artiest, I cannot express this.
 I have a better chance constructing a narrative around this, I've gotten
 good at wordceling my way through things.
 But I have no clear narrative, yet.
 I need to build a narrative that first defines what autopoesis is, and
 then incorporates retrotransposons as a kind of viral invader that became
 a permanent house–guest, and then became an indispensable fixture, and
 only then can I start to talk about weird minimalistic archea and bacteria
 that are more than viruses(?) but less than stand–alone cells.
 And all the while making references to the explosively large space of combinato
rial possibilities in which these systems are inhabitants.
 That is, I need an information–theoretic setting for all this.
 A way of talking about the size or volume of the informational space, and
 the size or volume of the frontier that is opened up with increasing complexity
 and architectural sophistication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frontier seems to be a key concept, here.
 Large molecules are not possible without small ones, first.
 I mean, yes, sure, given just a store of raw carbon, nitrogen, oxygen atoms,
 in atomic form, one can claim that one could construct a fern plant, but
 the reality is that one must first pass through frontiers of simple sugars
 and aminos, and only then speak of more complex biolmolecules, and only
 then talk of autopoesis, and metabolism, and self–replication, and only
 after that, multi–cellular life.
 These are all frontiers, and the space of possibilities expands as these
 are crossed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I write this, I think of the frontier as an equipotential, orthogonal
 to the gradient of complexity.
 But I don't know how to write an information–theoretic expression in such
 a way that there's some gradient that can be computed, even if it is plainly
 obvious that more complex systems are more complex than simpler systems;
 I don't know how to draw that arrow from simpler to more complex (or vice–versa
) in such a way that I can write down a derivative for it.
 I can imagine a slope from less complicated to more complicated, but gradients
 require an embedding space, a map from X to Y, so that a small change of
 x in X leads to some change of y in Y, where y is the Shannon information
 (or something like it) of the system in question.
 What is x? What kind of thing is x, that I can take a derivative with respect
 to it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I can do one of two things.
 I can give up, or I can keep going.
 If I keep going, I head off towards Kolmogorov complexity, and I associate
 x with perhaps the number of instructions needed to encode a register machine
 to perform some calculation, and I associate y with the logarithm of the
 size of the language, as a function of sentence length???
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I don't think I've ever seen that: Given a language L, defined as a collection
 of sentences S, each of which has length |S|, how many sentences are there
 of a fixed length n? Given combinatoric explosions, I should ask: what
 is the logarithm of the number of sentences of length n? This is a function
 from the integers to the language, and certainly derivatives, that is,
 finite differences, are possible, here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I imagine this, I now trigger sensations of Hausdorff dimension.
 But since languages are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

multi–fractals
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in general, the strict concept of Hausdorff dimension cannot apply, as
 different axiomatic subsets grow at different rates, and the addition of
 each new axiom, and/or of each new constraint (quotient, modulo) enlarges
 or limits the growth rate.
 For example, the free group in N generators grows as, um, given a sentence
 of length L, then there are 2N-1 more sentences of length L+1, because
 in a free group, I can append any of N generators, or N inverses, minus
 one for the cancelling elt.
 So, for first approximation, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(2N-1\right)^{L}$
\end_inset

 sentences of length L, and the log of this is 
\begin_inset Formula $L\log\left(2N-1\right)$
\end_inset

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $d/dL$
\end_inset

 of this is 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\left(2N-1\right)$
\end_inset

.
 But this is for the free group in 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 generators; group presentations reduce the number of distinct group elts.
 This is what I can generate with the group axioms only.
 If I also add another axiom, say, for addition, then I can generate more
 things, because there are now two operators that can be used to combine
 elts, and if these two operators are allowed to generate freely, then clearly,
 there will be even more sentences of a fixed length L.
 Because the axiom for an additional operator effectively introduces a new
 symbol.
 If I was careful and deliberative, I could even write down an expression
 for the size in a precise manner; but for now, I don't see why.
 Rather, this is to solidify the idea that the size of the frontier changes
 as ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, well, but that last sentence misleads.
 Adding axioms to an existing algebra does indeed change the dependency
 between sentence–length and number of sentences.
 But this is not a frontier, in the earlier sense.
 In the earlier sense, the frontier **was** located at a certain sentence–length.
 That is, single atoms of oxygen or nitrogen have length equal to one; sugar
 molecules and alcohols and aminos have length, uhh, two?? Or length equal
 to molecular weight?? Something like that?? And the next frontier is between
 the aminos, and small polypeptides.
 So how many biomolecules are there, less than of a certain given molecular
 weight?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This has several difficulties.
 One is that there are some highly unstable assemblages there, e.g.
 trinitrotoluene, and I mostly do NOT want to count those, as they are mostly
 irrelevant for biological life.
 A second difficulty comes from counting conformations and foldings, as
 these are vital for life, and improper foldings are not only rare, but
 are also sometimes toxic (e.g.
 CJD) or at any rate, not viable.
 A third difficulty arises when crossing the threshold of autopoesis, because
 now we must count not the size of some collection of molecules, but the
 size of the ecosystem itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So of course, I could say, I cannot write down a Shannon information–theoretic
 expression that is a differentiable function of sentence length, because
 I've lost the ability to talk about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

sentence length
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 even before I got to ecological systems.
 And the human noosphere of ideas ...
 forget it.
 Sure, I love to equate the noosphere with the space of all possible abstract
 algebraic expressions generated by all possible first–order models of terms
 and relations and logical connectives, but this is perhaps not the correct
 thing, as this space is huge, whereas humans think about love and kindness
 and warfare and perfumes.
 Just as I wanted to exclude TNT from my count of functional and significant
 biomolecules, so also I want to exclude almost all algebraic constructions
 from the noosphere of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

significant ideas

 Which is yet another thing I don't know how to do yet.

 I am stuck in the friction of the day.
 There is no smooth sailing from Shannon entropy to frontiers of complexity.
 There is friction at every step.

\begin_layout Standard
Well, perhaps it is time to redouble my efforts into the algebraic explorer.
 I don't exactly see Hebrew letters, when I view the world, but sometimes,
 I can imagine that I could, if I only placed both feet across that mighty
 slippery edge, instead of just one.
 Alas, I am mostly sane, no matter how much fun I imagine myself having
 in trying to explore the boundaries of sanity.
 My brain, in it's current form, seems sufficiently self–correcting that
 while I can give a pretty good imitation of a crazy, high–on–crack enlightened
 buddhist ready to start a crazed sex cult at the first sight of a woman
 bending over to pick something up, my free–thinker soul is not so liberated
 that I could cross over and literally do something I would get arrested
 for and placed in a mental institution.
 I can see LSD traces, if I really really want to, but that is not so interestin
g (any more).
 And I do see patterns everywhere, and those does remain interesting.
 And these patterns are jigsaw pieces, not Hebrew letters, and the boundary
 between literal and figurative, sleep, dreams and wakefulness becomes at
 times blurred, but never so blurred that I don't find both my feet planted
 on this side of sanity.
 Which is a good thing, no matter how much romantic impulses suggest that
 one must be a bit insane to gain enlightenment and have ineffable revelations.
 All of which ...
 well, I know of the ineffable, and enlightenment, and romantic impulses,
 only because I've read about them in literary magazines, and otherwise
 I would be utterly unfamiliar with the abstraction of societal conventions
 of normalicy as articulated by Sigmund Freud, and instead, living in a
 small village in Lithuania in the 19th century, be only dimly aware of
 the intellectual stirrings in the larger cities.
 And so now, at the start of the 21st century, my thoughts and abilities
 are limited by what I can absorb from social media and arxiv and biorxiv
 and youtube.
 If someone else has not yet invented and articulated an idea, and if I
 haven't heard of it in some way, then I would be hard–pressed to move far
 beyond that point.
 The friction of the day prevents my own personal progress.
 My own personal progress towards what? Enlightenment, god–hood, immortality,
 self–understanding, the meaning of life and all that.
 And I think these are all things I want to do, because I guess, what, I
 have to thank the Ancient Greek philosophers for having the free time to
 think about what it all means, and then having the good sense to write
 it all down? And if I were a Scythian, and did not write it down? If I
 was a mongol, astride a horse, overtaken by blood–lust? Because that is
 certainly another possibility for existence; it just does not seem to be
 a possibility on the track of eschatological self–enlightenment of the
 universe.
 Because this does seem to be a shining, undeniable truth, a certain anchor–poin
t that cannot be denied: that the universe wants to be self–aware, and wishes
 to come into being.
 But, wait, what am I writing here? Well, this last sentences was already
 articulated in the apocrypha, in the Roman Mithras, in Manicheanism, and
 all the rest; this is not a new perception.
 So whence this perception, that the universe seeks self–enlightenment?
 Is this something that neanderthals would also have understood, however
 vaguely? Is this something capuchin monkeys might understand, if only we
 could devise a suitable psychological experiment to demonstrate such beliefs
 in monkeys? That is, is the belief of the divine, is this a mammalian trait?
 Do all mammals hear the call of God? How about reptiles? What about insects
 and trees? At any rate, my personal strivings for divinity are well within
 bounds of typical human behavior.
 And perhaps find a suitable setting in the search for meaning.
 And I wrote about meaning just yesterday, but I do not recall what I wrote.
 I do recall writing that forgetfullness could be taken as nihilism, or
 even be considered evil.
 And I would not at all be surprised if I were told that some Jewish Gaon
 of some earlier time had already pointed out the evil of forgetfullness.
 And this is the conundrum of thinking...
 how does one arrive at novel thoughts? Well, even that question, I proposed
 a mechanistic answer for, provisional, however it might be: given the vague
 impression–thought hallucination of an LLM, could that to some system that
 can do science, computing, generate and check proofs, that system can then
 convert intuitions into knowledge.
 And so again, I seem to be psyching myself up for tackling this project,
 having perhaps found the next stepping stone; perhaps a stepping stone
 within reach.
 What am I doing here? I'm spewing words as fast as I can type them.
 I can think just a little bit faster than I can type.
 I can even fact–check my own thoughts faster than I can type.
 Of course, what I do type fails to impress me with it's depth or insight;
 I feel like a second–rate has–been scholar, prattling on about something
 insubstantial and unimportant, no matter how much it posses me to write
 it just right now.
 But this is just self–indulgence of the worst sort.
 If I took these thoughts and spun them into some novel, and took it to
 some publisher, then I would have something I could sell, and provide entertain
ment to those who buy novels and read them: I could be adding to the common
 good.
 But wait, this is a very 19th or 20th century perception of common good:
 that, in capitalism (and also Soviet communism) the creative class should
 limit itself to creative endevours that advance the good of human–kind,
 and not engage in the wretched self–indulgence that drunken artistes are
 prone to.
 So what am I? A not–currently–at–this–moment drunk artiste? High on coffee,
 to be more precise? I must go pee, išsisinti tą kavą? Or is my self–indulgent
 diarizing here just cannon–fodder for some LLM to scrape, read, and pretend
 understanding of what it means to be alive, aware, trapped in the here–and–now,
 searching for meaning, connection, experience, self–awareness even as I
 battle the friction of beingness? Well, I am certainly on a roll, here.
 I did not put paragraph breaks into the above, intentionally; I wanted
 it to be one big run–on thought, because paragraph breaks imply considered
 reasoning and structuring into topics, whereas I am writing from whole
 cloth, a conetinous, endless stream–of–consciousness outpouring of whatever
 it is that my mind decided might be a good thing for my fingers to type,
 with no particularly strong self–guidance, but rather a letting loose of
 a ...
 sequence of ...
 oh my, I can't complete that sentence, b ecause I did not like any of the
 endings.
 So it seems I have some editorial control over what I write here.
 But I try to exercise it modestly, for now.
 Because why? Because editorial control requires effort, and that effort
 ties one out.
 Whereas my current bout of glossolalia feels effortless, like skating on
 ice, I feel like I could do this all day without tiring.
 Whereas focus, of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 variety, is freakin exhausting.
 Forcing is a way of making progress, at least, for solving math and physics,
 and is necessary, there.
 But for this stream of mind–is–on–vacation–while my mouth is working overtime
 efforts here, well, my mind is on vacation.
 And that is not a bad place to be, even if I get nothing from this besides
 sitting on a beach with a Pina Colada.
 Which is something else that humans do.
 So what am I now? Unapologetically human? Or should I apologize: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 And all of the many songs I liked, and I've starred on youtube, and collected
 into playlists, which then got holes punched into them due to copyright
 complaints, and then those holes were erased, with the hope that I what?
 Won't remember that I once liked a song that is copyrighted, and the copyright
 owner wants me to forget that I ever liked the song? What, exactly, does
 that achieve, except to keep some lawyer busy, and charge some client some
 money so that they can grow rich while I forget and the clients interests
 are ultimately not served? This is unfair.
 But the war in Ukraine is unfair, and even as I type this, Ukrainians die.
 Lets see, the katsaps die at the rate of 1000 a day, so maybe 100 katsaps
 died while I wrote the above, and Ukrainians experience a six to one rate,
 so maybe 15 Unkrainians died in this same time period? What can I do? Not
 exactly helpless, but I could donate time, donate money, work efforts in
 that direction.
 Is this what I want? Is this what I really want? Why am I not doing it?
 How can I be innocent and saintly, without taking a more active role in
 that conflict? Garg.
 I think this might be a very good time to stop typing, and go so something
 else.
 Au revoir.
