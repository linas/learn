\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-E
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
June 2025 – present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language–learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten–D, which got
 over–long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am making the assumption that
 no human being will ever actually read this.
 Thus, it is filled with random stuff I feel like writing.
 Some of it is very personal, some of it is nonsense.
 Mostly, I am finding that the act of writing helps otherwise vague and
 scattered thoughts quantum–collapse into a more coherent form, where I
 can examine them, like a dead butterfly pinned down in a display case.
 Dead words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
If you are interested in this content, then you should ask an AI agent to
 read it, then pretended that it's me, then ask about it.
 I believe that present–day LLM technology is sufficiently advanced to be
 able to do this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Ten already got an introduction.
 A different way of thinking is about what is going on here is that this
 is a form of life–logging.
 Or, in 18th century terms, a diary.
 Just not anywhere near as compelling as those written by the famous diarists.
 This one is more of a mental self–portrait.
 And not even for you but for myself.
 Not to cast a narcissistic gaze at my own words, but to organize my own
 thoughts.
 Still in the experimental stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
4 June 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once more into the breach.
 So I really should write up here–and–now formally, because I think I have
 good results that are worth stating publicly.
 I am, however, stuck with thermalization.
 This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs.
 I've been fumbling with some ideas, but they break apart before I get very
 far.
 I think I wrote a to–do list task before, but let me try again:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Given some graph, what can be said about the (eigenvalue) spectrum of that
 graph? Presumably, the set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all graphs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be divided into distinct regions, with first and second–order phase
 transitions between these regions.
 What kind of a research program has the power to create this map? I can
 certainly start by doing some experimental work, I guess, but this is a
 major project.
 Explore a collection of small graphs.
 Some regular graphs e.g.
 grids.
 Random graphs with various typical statistical properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do the wave–vector work.
 Where I last left this was that there should be wave–vectors associated
 with graph automorphisms.
 Some automorphism groups will be abelian – e.g.
 those for conventional solid–state physics on crystalline lattices.
 Others will be non–abelian, I have no clue what those are, and making progress
 seems to require brute force work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The graph approach to thermalization then suggests that the 3D structure
 of space might be emergent.
 That the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

actual
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 quantum world may live on some graph or hypergraph structure (we can vectorize
 hypergraphs into graphs, thanks to tensoring.) And the 3D structure of space
 may in fact be some phase–transition boundary, some critical point, where
 graphs on one side fail to have a spectrum that gives thermalization, and
 graphs on the other side do.
 This makes space emergent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What about spacetime? Is space–time emergent? The core graph model still
 has a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 that appears as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{n}\tau}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}$
\end_inset

 one of the eigenvalues, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 looks a lot like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, the Renninger setup emphasizes that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 will map to many distinct and different values of lab–frame proper time,
 so that different space–time regions in different parts of the lab, correspond
 to the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, but just in different parts of the graph.
 So if my graph is 
\begin_inset Formula $G=G_{L}\otimes B\otimes G_{R}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 the narrow bridge, and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 the large thermal tanks, then states on 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 evolved as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{n}\tau}$
\end_inset

 even though 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to one side of the lab, in the lab–frame–proper–time past of
 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 is another spatial region, in the lab–frame–proper–time future of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

.
 So, in this sense, time is also emergent, but it seems that also lab–frame
 proper–time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 maps to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 linearly.
 Well, more strongly: well, denote 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}$
\end_inset

 as the lab–frame proper time in 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and likewise for 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}$
\end_inset

 and thus I hypothesize that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}-t_{L}=\mbox{const.}>0$
\end_inset

 so that proper time runs at constant speed in both halves, because they
 are stationary with respect to one–another.
 i.e.
 no relativistic time dilation.
 And more: that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}-\tau=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}-\tau=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 really is the proper time in the rest frame, even though in some parts
 of the lab, it's in the future, and some parts of the lab, its in the past.
 This is for the Renninger setup, where the detectors are strictly time–like
 ordered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For the Clauser–Aspect–Zeilinger type setup, where the left and right sides
 of the lab are space–like separated when the measurements are made, then
 it is not legal to talk about 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}-t_{L}$
\end_inset

 because if the issue of selecting a space–like surface on which to define
 these two.
 However, we must still have that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}-\tau=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}-\tau=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 and, in a certain sense, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}=t_{R}$
\end_inset

 because these space–like separated regions are both happening at the same
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 That is, both 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 are happening at the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, even though they are space–like separated from one–another.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the here–and–now parameter.
 It does not (cannot) specify a space–like surface, because for the Renninger
 setup, it becomes time–like, even though 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is still the same here–and–now parameter.
 So, in this sense, space–time is emergent from the graph, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 can be recognized as advancing at speed one in the lab rest frame, and
 thus identifiable as proper time, even though it cannot be used to order
 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

, because both 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 are at the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, irrespective of whether 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 are space–like or time–like separated in the lab.
 I think this all makes sense, but clearly I am struggling with algebraic
 formalities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How it is that the Minkowski structure of space–time emerges from the 
\begin_inset Formula $G=G_{L}\otimes B\otimes G_{R}$
\end_inset

 structure is entirely unclear.
 Perhaps there have to be many bridges 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 connecting many sub–graphs.
 So this then becomes a question: what's the tensor algebra decomposition
 if we have some regions like 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 that are densely connected, and a bunch of thin bridges connecting these
 dense parts? Under what circumstances with a 3+1 decomposition arise for
 such graphs? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I kick back here, and here's the train of thought.
 I would like to ask an LLM how to thermalize, but they are too stupid to
 answer that question.
 Because the LLM's don't understand graph theory, algebra, tensors, none
 of that.
 Nor can they run experiments on matrices.
 I can't ask the LLM to compute the eigenvalues of things, and then to fiddle
 the algebra for me, and do it again.
 Search for phase transitions on large graphs.
 I want to automate my science experiment.
 But how?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I would like to build an algebra explorer.
 Now, mathematicians have developed plenty of theorem–proving tools.
 I think I know how those go, I don't yet see how to leverage them.
 Should I build an algebra system founded on Atomese, as the substrate?
 Yes, I probably should.
 Should I combine it with the current ideas about agency and evidence? Yes,
 I should.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did have a chance to recap the story of MOSES for someone, yesterday,
 and recapping that, I got to review the issues associated with recursive
 self–improvement that were hit by MOSES.
 There are many issues.
 One serious issue was the use of an objective function which was to be
 optimized.
 This is doomed, it's a paperclip–maximizer.
 The accretion–agglomeration concept of perception and agency is the only
 plausible replacement that I have for that.
 One of the issues was that, when looking at MOSES as an explorer of a search
 space, that search space grows combinatorially with the program complexity.
 It explodes, out of control, and the learning curves plateau out, because
 the terrain becomes locally very flat, there's no gradient to climb.
 This is something we already know from natural selection: the solution
 space looks like a golf–course: a large expanse of nearly flat territory:
 noise, mostly, disturbing the flatness.
 And after a long and difficult search, you find the hole.
 Sink the golf–ball, and now you emerge on a new terrain, that is much much
 bigger than before.
 Ugh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The accretion–agglomeration model avoids this.
 Instead, you are sticking parts onto other parts, and yes, of course, there
 are ever–more possibilities, but who cares? Stick them together, and see
 if the result is functional...
 what does it mean to be functional? Well, maybe this is the other road–block.
 If you have an agent in an environment, all it can do is go out there and
 play.
 It plays, it learns a few things.
 Gets more sophisticated at playing ...
 and then what? Ugh.
 The universe it inhabits is a dream–world, it wanders through this universe,
 exhibiting curiosity and playfulness, but mostly hallucinating what it
 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

out there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the universe, as opposed to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in here
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inside the agent.
 But perhaps I am personifying too much.
 The agent is more like that critical sandpile, accreting new experiences
 and information, sloughing off in avalanches, both of the universe and
 in the universe, with a boundary between the two that is both clear–cut
 and also ambiguous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever.
 This is a nice model of agency.
 Should I build it? Just earlier, I wanted an algebraic system.
 So I guess what I really want is an agent that can wander through the space
 of algebra.
 How can I build that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I want 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

like an LLM, but for algebra
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but I don't want an LLM literally, because I don't want to train it on
 algebra, I want it to discover algebra.
 So, in some sense, an axiom–explorer.
 Generate a collection of axioms, treat these as jigsaw pieces, then randomly
 assemble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So lets try this with the axioms of set theory? Step one: how do I encode
 the axioms of set theory as jigsaws? Step two: how do I generate novel
 combinations? Perhaps the universe of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

out there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 needs to be the collection of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all possible jigsaws
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (aka 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all possible axioms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and the agent is an explorer that attempts to grab these, and assemble
 them.
 What does it mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

to assemble
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Well, conventionally, these are proofs – collisions of axioms that can
 be assembled, and then eventually terminate.
 For conventional mathematics, they terminate in true/false.
 I suppose true and false can be considered to be jigsaws themselves.
 A characteristic of proofs is that they start with small theorems, blow
 up large in the middle of the proof, and then terminate.
 I suspect what I really want is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reverse mathematics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, start with nothing, let the thing blow up, and then wait for it to become
 small again: to reduce.
 The result off the reduction is now the theorem.
 The theorem can now be added to the collection of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

known things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The collection of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

known things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are then used during generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, generation can be viewed as a kind of exploration.
 What is the difference, really, between MOSES–style genetic generation,
 and, say exhaustive generation, such as odometers (Markov odometers, etc.)
 and just, I dunno ...
 random accretion...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is the dictionary of accumulated knowledge, well, nominally, it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

internal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the agent, but to the generator, it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

external
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: it is a place where the agent can get things, and put things (i.e.
 get things that represent axioms and theorems, and put new theorems when
 they are discovered.
 So, its memory.
 It's memory exclusive to the agent, i.e.
 incorruptible by other agents working in the external world.
 In a multi–agent system, one will want to have a common, shared memory,
 when multiple agents can contribute new discoveries.
 Unlike the private memory, this risks 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

corruption
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or unexpected changes.
 Of course, the external memory is a communications channel between agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wonder if I should use the pi–calculus as the API to memory.
 it is certainly a minimal model for a multi–agent communications system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then my thoughts zoom off again.
 The pi–calculus can also be used as..
 well, suppose we have communication over links, on graphs ...
 Can I look at pi–calculus as some fragment of linear logic?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which runs me back into a circle: the classical world is a Cartesian category,
 the quantum world is the dagger–symmetric category; these are known fragments,
 that is, monoidal categories with some additional axioms.
 Which I could try to work out by hand, being careful to articulate what's
 the same, what's different.
 Perhaps these axioms assemble in a way that resemble Ext and Tor.
 There are just such a large variety of analogies that can be made, that
 can be imagined, some of which are maybe widely useful, some maybe dead–ends,
 and it is very tempting to be the olde–school mathematician and tackle
 these with pencil and paper, when in fact I recognize an axiomatic system
 that should be explored using a generative apparatus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So maybe I should just say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fuck it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and start writing code to implement the vision above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before I do that, how much time should I sped trying to imagine a structural
 encoding in terms of binary strings?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I want to bootstrap this, and get to self–modifying ASAP.
 How? Is pi–calculus a place to start?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is that premature?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should I experiment with a specific task? Should I create a system that
 can do eigenvector solving on a graph, and let it then explore algebraic
 variants, and thereby maybe discover number fields or something like that?
 Of course, if it does do this, how do I attach this back to the English
 language? I need to talk to it.
 If it discovers a well–known mathematical concept, I certainly do NOT want
 to try to read through the axioms and figure out what it was.
 So I also need the evidence–solver, to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

these two things are probably the same.
 Except, for pure math, I need to have it work 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

absolutely, certainly the same
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and not fuzzy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...
 and so I need the unifier.
 Unification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crap.
 Where to start.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I need a connector–upper.
 Except the existing query engine can do that.
 Except it has a complicated syntax.
 So its like re–inventing lisp: step one: what is the most minimal system?
 Step two? How can I create a description of the minimal system, so that
 reasoning can be performed on it? That is, how do I create a minimal system
 that is self–describing? I have lots of parts I can use; how do I ...
 ??? Step four: Profit!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I need to reinvent the URE, but doing it correctly, this time ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I want to have a gas of rules, with some ..
 Boltzmann distribution, and then have it do self–chemistry, evolutionary
 chemistry on itself.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

memory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the collection of molecules that get discovered.
 But what of the combinatoric explosion?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somehow, RNN's got past the combinatoric explosion.
 How? Well, for starters, RNN's are trained; there's an objective function,
 they're trying to minimize it.
 But I don't have an objective function; I just have an agent that wants
 to try all possibilities.
 How can I get agents to team up? I can imagine each node in an RNN diagram,
 the attention heads, whatever, as an individual agent, and each one tried
 to hook up somehow with the other agents, accepting inputs and delivering
 outputs...
 who hooks these up? How is the data pumped? Whence does the data come from?
 I've got pipes carrying data.
 The recursive step is to have pipes carrying pipes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RNN used a vector encoding.
 Symbols were sprayed onto an n–dimensional sphere, uniformly.
 Then symbol sequences ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
6 June 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thought about the wave vectors in the middle of the night, while tossing
 and turning.
 It's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not that hard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, even if the symmetry group of the graph is non–abelian.
 Keywords are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal subgroup
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

group center
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So, for example, imagine the group has as a subgroup the cyclic group 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Corresponding to this will be a collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 eigenfunctions, having the form 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\pi km/n}$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th atom in the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th harmonic.
 Just basic standing–wave harmonics on a necklace with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 beads.
 The energy (eigenvalue) of each mode will be 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{k}$
\end_inset

 with higher 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 being higher energy: these will not be degenerate eigenmodes.
 However, the eigenmodes will be degenerate, in general, depending on the
 divisibility of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 So, for example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is divisible by four, and we consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $k=4$
\end_inset

'th harmonic, there will be 
\begin_inset Formula $n/4$
\end_inset

 distinct eigenmodes, offset by a phase factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $1,e^{i\pi k/n},e^{i\pi2k/n},\cdots$
\end_inset

 obtained by rotating the ring, i.e.
 by restarting the numbering of the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th atom by 
\begin_inset Formula $0,1,2,\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 These are orthogonal.
 All of them are degenerate, having the same energy.
 The generator of the cyclic group 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 can be envisioned as a displacement: it just rotates the necklace by one
 step.
 This generator just carries the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|k,p\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 eigenfunction to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|k,p+1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 eigenfunction, for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le p<n/k$
\end_inset

.
 Instead of using words, I guess I should use formulas: the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th atom has 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle m\vert k,p\right\rangle =e^{i\pi k\left(m+p\right)/n}=e^{i\pi km/n}e^{i\pi kp/n}=e^{i\pi kp/n}\left\langle m\vert k,0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever.
 The point is that for each cyclic subgroup of the symmetry group, there's
 an associated subset of the eigenvectors that are characterized by a collection
 of orthogonal modes of this conventional standing–wave form, that are character
ized by a momentum wave–vector that is some integral multiple of the length
 of that cyclic subgroup.
 There's also the energy, the eigenvalue for each mode.
 What is not clear is the dispersion relation that connects the two.
 Is it linear? Does it have the form of a quadratic polynomial, i.e.
 having the form 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{2}=a_{1}p_{1}^{2}+a_{2}p_{2}^{2}+\cdots+m^{2}$
\end_inset

 for constants 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},a_{2,}\cdots,m^{2}$
\end_inset

? Or is it some polynomial with higher order terms? I guess it could be
 something else entirely...
 although a characterization in terms of the cyclic subgroups remains key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For large random graphs with 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{23}$
\end_inset

 vertices in them, what is the distribution of the graph automorphism groups?
 What does it mean to have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a random graph
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Getting the automorphism group is hard.
 What about the homology groups of the graph? How are they distributed?
 Is there a relation between the homology groups, and the automorphism group?
 For every homology group of higher order, I can imagine a collection of
 harmonics on that group.
 How do those harmonics tie into the spectrum? I don't recall seeing anything
 that touches on such questions.
 I guess I should ask some LLM to see if it knows anything about stuff like
 this.
 Which is more work, more reading.
 The other possibility is to just make an exhaustive list of small graphs,
 and see if a pattern emerges...
 when? When will I have time to do this?

I want to revist certain portions of as–moses.
 But how? Well, I want to create random networks of image processing functions,
 but how? Moses hard–wired a bunch of primitives, and used knob–turning.
 It would be nice to have a dictionary of parts, instead of it being hard–wired.

LTN Logic Tensor Networks has a DL/NN structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While I search for that tab to refresh my memory, I glance at the model–context–
protocol page, and am reminded that I need an MCP for the atomspace, to
 talk about what is in there.
 A demo tutorial.

LTN is here: https://github.com/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks It
 is actually kind–of useless.
 It embeds atomic constants as vectors, predicates as matrices or tensors,
 and atomic formulas as graphs.
 Logic connectives use fuzzy semantics, quantifiers are aggregates, the
 whole mess is converted to tensorflow graphs.
 See the README there for more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is this useless? Well, because the list of logic connectives is hard–coded
 – and, or, not, implies.
 The variables are hard–coded as lists of possible individuals, quantifiers
 are hard–coded as mean.
 And the whole thing is pushed into tensorflow.
 which is maybe the only interesting thing, since it provides a mapping
 of predicate logic into a funky fuzzy NN logic.
 Which is ...
 interesting.

Now, lets compare to PLN.
 The idea of PLN was to do forward chaining, backward chaining, etc.
 to find logical inferences, given a collection of inference rules given
 in the PLN book.
 So the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cool project
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to do would be to ..
 well create an automatic chainer, and then convert the chain into LTN–style
 tensorflow networks.
 Except that, of course, we want to use MOSES–style tree decorations instead
 of chainers.
 And we want to use not MOSES decorators, but a generic jigsaw random assembly
 system.
 And I have been stuck at exactly this point for years.
 Some kind of ...
 mental block, I know what I want I seem unable to get it.
 Cue Sex Pistols for the refrain.
 The jigsaws are ...
 link–grammar disjuncts.
 I tried ten years ago with the Viterbi parser, which ran out of CPU and
 was slow.
 The LG parser is fast.
 So ...
 what's the problem?

\begin_layout Standard
Where do I begin? I have a cascade ot tasks here.
 I need to organize them into priority.
 Tomorrow, maybe.
 I'm tired, now.

\begin_layout Standard
Well, the above got me so excited, I could not fall asleep.
 I fought the urge to get up and work on it all night.
 I could not find the usual mindset that would nock me out, sleeping.
 Perhaps I drank too much coffee the day before, but I doubt it.
 I also resumed taking magnesium threonate, the second time after a month
 not taking it, and maybe that kept me awake.
 I've noticed that hard thinking makes me sleepy, so I thought I'd work
 on a boring math problem in my head, till that knocked me out.
 Took a while, but it did.
 And thus, first thing this morning, instead of working on the above, I
 has some minor math results to report.
 Crap.
 Here goes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the math problem is to find the eigenvalues of the fully connected graph.
 The clique graph.
 The Hamiltonian for oscillators that interact via graph edges.
 This has the Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 with 1 on the diagonal and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 for all off–diagonal entries.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{ij}=\delta_{ij}+\epsilon\left(1-\delta_{ij}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 For small 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

, the rows and columns are already almost orthonormal.
 Geometrically, the rows and columns form an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

–cube, a bit sheared and compressed along the diagonal 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{0}=\left[1,1,\cdots,1\right]=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}e_{k}$
\end_inset

, and completely rotationally symmetric about this axis.
 The eigenvalue is 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{0}=1+\left(n-1\right)\epsilon$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $Hv_{0}=E_{0}v_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The remaining eigenvectors are all degenerate, and have the energy 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}=1-\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 The rotational symmetry gives a large choice for picking the eigenvectors.
 It will be convenient to set 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}=e_{0}-e_{k}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in\left\{ 1,\cdots,n-1\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 This gives 
\begin_inset Formula $Hv_{k}=E_{1}v_{k}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

 are not orthonormal.
 Although 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{0}\cdot v_{k}=n\delta_{k0}$
\end_inset

 we do have 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}\cdot v_{j}=1$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j>0$
\end_inset

.
 I didn't notice this while sleeping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, we want to entangle 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{0}$
\end_inset

 with a Renninger photon, or a Clauser–Aspect–Zeilinger doublet.
 For now, lets just hit it with a hammer.
 That is, decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{0}$
\end_inset

 into a superposition.
 For this, note that 
\begin_inset Formula $ne_{0}=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}v_{k}$
\end_inset

, and so by normalizing appropriately, we find that hitting 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{0}$
\end_inset

 with a hammer excites all the modes.
 They're not normal modes, because I screwed up and did not orthogonalize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, what was interesting was asking the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how long before recurrence?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 given that each state evolves as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{1}t}$
\end_inset

 and the diagonal as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{0}t}$
\end_inset

? Well, for my non–orthonormal basis, the answer is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

really fast.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 And so for the Renninger setup, if one tank is a clique of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 oscillators and the other is of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 oscillators, connected by a single edge, then the wave function 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

collapses
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into one tank, then 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

uncollapses
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and goes into the other tank, resonating at some ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $m/n$
\end_inset

.
 And of course, this is what we expect, given that the system is in a whole
 completely linear; there's no non–linear dissipative term, and we're dealing
 with the problem of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wigner's friend
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 But I knew that coming in, the goal was to ...
 I dunno.
 Think about this till I fell asleep.
 And so there we are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other thoughts were abut what if 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is small but random for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\ne j$
\end_inset

, and what if 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is tri–diagonal (a linear chain, but we know that already) and I look at
 the edges as defining 1-simplexes, and triangles as 2-simplexes, then what
 if the graph is constructed to have 3-simplexes only? i.e.
 a cell complex of dimension 3, a piece–wise tessellation of a 3-manifold?
 I don't know the answers.
 But again, since we're always dealing with a linear system, its always
 Wigner's friend.
 Nothing is evaded here.
 Still, interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coda: The issue is that points 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-iE_{k}t}\left|k\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 always live on an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

–torus, and at best those orbits become dense on the torus if the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{k}$
\end_inset

 are pair–wise irrational.
 Which makes them barely ergodic, and certainly not mixing.
 If we hope to do better, we need some deformation of that torus.
 Or perhaps abandon the lab–frame Newtonian pseudo–time, so different paths
 can arrive at the same point with different times.
 The obvious candidates, special and general relativity are covariant.
 If curvature can be used to generate mixing, its far beyond the intellectual
 apparatus I've set up so far.
