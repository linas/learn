; Unit test for merging of Shapes.
;
; This tests (unreliably) an order-dependent merge bug. It's unreliable,
; because the bug only shows up if the merge order is done wrong, and so
; this unit test won't always trigger on bad code. But .. hey, lets try.
;
; Here's the problem:
; Start with
;    N (f, a- a+)  and  M (f, b- a+)
; and merge a & b. The crosses are:
;    N [a, <f, $- a+>] + M [b, <f, $- a+>] -- Yes, merge!
;    N [a, <f, a- $+>] + 0 [b, <f, a- $+>] -- oh no!
;    M [a, <f, b- $+>] + 0 [b, <f, b- $+>] -- oh no!
; If we hit the first one, we merge and rebalance, and the merge
; knocks out the next two (since the merge rebuilds the sections
; and the cross-sections). But if either of the "oh no!"'s are
; hit first, the merge is rejected, and the "Yes, merge!" case
; is never considered, and so never happens. Hmm.  To fix this,
; the merge order on shapes is reordered so that the mergeable
; ones are always performed first.
