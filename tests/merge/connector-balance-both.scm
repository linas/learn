; connector-balance-both.scm
; Unit test for merging of Connectors - detailed balance in multi-connectors
;
; Tests merging of several words into a single word-class.
; The focus here is to make sure that detailed balance of the counts
; across the merged Sections and CrossSections are preserved (obeyed).
; A variant of connector-balance.scm, where both the germ and the
; connectors are merged.

; Created Dec 2021

; ---------------------------------------------------------------
;
; This diagram explains what is being tested here:
;
;    (a, gh) + (b, gh) -> ({ab}, gh)
;    (a, kaaam)        -> ({ab}, k{ab}{ab}{ab}m)
;
; This differs from `connector-balance.scm` in that the second term has
; a merged seed, vs. being `(c, kaaam)` in the simpler test.
;
; In this diagram, (e,abc) is abbreviated notation for
; (Section (Word e) (ConnectorList (Connector a) (Connector b) (Connector c)))
; and so on.
; {ej} is short for (WordClassNode "e j") (a set of two words)
;
; What about the CrossSections?
; We expect 9 to be created, 2 each for the first two, and 5 for the last.
; For example, (a, gh) explodes to
;    [g, <a, vh>] and  [h, <a, gv>]
; where [] denotes the CrossSection, and <> denotes the Shape. The "v"
; is the variable node in the Shape (that the germ of the cross-section
; plugs into).
;
; The (a, kaaam) explodes to
;    [k, <a, vaaam>]
;    [a, <a, kvaam>]
;    [a, <a, kavam>]
;    [a, <a, kaavm>]
;    [m, <a, kaaav>]
;
; These should stay consistent with the merged sections. i.e. these
; should reduce to 2 grand-total sections, with appropriate counts.
