;
; This diagram explains what is being tested here:
;
;    ({ej}, abc) + ({rs}, abc) -> ({ej}, abc)
;    ({ej}, klm) +     none    -> ({ej}, klm)
;        none    + ({rs}, dgh) -> ({ej}, dgh)
;
; In this diagram, (e,abc) is abbreviated notation for
; (Section (Word e) (ConnectorList (Connector a) (Connector b) (Connector c)))
; and so on.
; {ej} is short for (WordClassNode "e j") (a set of two words)
;
; What about the CrossSections?
; We expect 12 to be created, 3 each for the 4 total Sections.
; For example, ({ej}, abc) explodes to
;    [a, <{ej}, vbc>]   and  [b, <{ej}, avc>]  and  [c, <{ej}, abv>]
; where [] denotes the CrossSection, and <> denotes the Shape. The "v"
; is the variable node in the Shape (that the germ of the cross-section
; plugs into).
;
; These should stay consistent with the merged sections. i.e. these
; should reduce to 9=12-6+3 grand-total, with appropriate counts.
; All 9 of them will have {ej} as the point, none will have {rs} as
; the point.
