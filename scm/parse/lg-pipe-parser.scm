; XXX FIXME. The next 30 lines of code are a cut-n-paste of the
; pair parsing pipeline code. It is needed because the batch processor
; force-feeds use text, instead of allowing us to read on our own.
; It just wires up a pipeline to feed text.

; If the current cog-storage-node never changes, then the parser only
; needs to be created only once. In the long term, there is a reasonable
; expectation that maybe this should work with multiple different storage
; nodes, maybe even a different one in each thread? This futre remains
; uncertain, so for now, assume only one global. FIXME someday, if
; needed.

   make-block-mpg-pipe-observer -- Make an observer for counting
      MST/MPG disjuncts in text blocks. Uses the Atomese pipeline.

   The returned function has the form:

   func TEXT-BLOCK
      Impose a sliding window on the TEXT-BLOCK, and then submit
      everything in that window for MPG/MST parsing.

   TEXT-BLOCK is a utf8 string of text. A sliding window is created
   on that text block, of default width 12. The words within the
   window are then sent to the LG parser, using the 'dict-pair'
   dictionary.  This dictionary is presumed to hold word-pairs
   with valid word-MI on them, accessible via the `BondNode ANY`
   EvaluationLinks.

   The LG parser creates MST/MPG parses using that dictionary.
   Then the count on each disjunct in the parse is incremented.

   This is a block observer, because, at this point, we do not yet know
   where the sentence boundaries might be, and so a sliding window is
   used to examine everything in the general vicinity.
