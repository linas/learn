  point. This code is thread-safe.

  Warning: this is NOT SAFE for distributed processing! That is
  because this does NOT grab the count from the database every time,
  so if some other process updates the database, this will miss that
  update. Multiple distributed counters will continue to clobber
  each-other indefinitely; the system will NOT settle-down long-term.
