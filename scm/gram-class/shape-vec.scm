; Representing connector-words as vectors over shapes (word-shape pairs)

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
; OVERVIEW
; --------
; This file provides a "matrix-object" API that allows words to be
; treated as vectors, with the word taken to live inside of a connector,
; and the vector basis ranging over all section-shapes (that contain
; that word in a connector).
;
; A key idea in grammatical classification is that words can be treated
; as vectors, and thus, vector-style algorithms can be applied to them.
; There are many kinds of vectors that are possible:
; -- N-grams, where a word is associated with a vector of counts of
;    the neighboring N words.
; -- skip-grams, as above, but some words are skipped.
; Neither of the above are implemented anywhere in this directory, but
; they convey the idea of a word-vector.
;
; Another vector is a word-disjunct vector, where the word is associated
; with a vector of counts of how often a disjunct is associated with it.
; This is implemented in `pseudo-csets.scm`.  Its a good place to start.
; The word-disjunct vectors behave a whole lot like skip-grams, for many
; practical purposes.
;
; The vector *IN THIS FILE* is between a word living in a connector,
; and all sections that contain that connector. This allows one to look
; at how contexts cross over to other linked words.  It is looking at
; disjuncts from the connector point of view.
;
; Consider, for example, the word "level". It can appear in a connector
; both as
;
;    (Connector (WordNode "level") (ConnectorDir "-"))
;
; and as
;
;    (Connector (WordNode "level") (ConnectorDir "+"))
;
; One of these connectors appears in the section
;
;    (Section
;       (WordNode "playing")
;       (ConnectorSeq
;          (Connector
;             (WordNode "level")
;             (ConnectorDir "-"))
;          (Connector
;             (WordNode "field")
;             (ConnectorDir "+"))))
;
; and therefore, this section is paired with (WordNode "level")
;
; Left wild-cards
; ---------------
; In the above example, the corresponding left-wildcard for "level"
; would be (conceptually) the shape:
;
;    (Section
;       (WordNode "playing")
;       (ConnectorSeq
;          (Connector
;             (Variable "$wildcard")
;             (ConnectorDir "-"))
;          (Connector
;             (WordNode "field")
;             (ConnectorDir "+"))))
;
; I.e. with (Variable "$wildcard") replacing (WordNode "level")
; These wildcards are needed to store the left-marginals.  In practice,
; we don't want to pollute the namespace with ConnectorSeq's and
; Sections that have variables in them, so the actual representation is
; flattened. See below for its actual form.
;
; Its convenient to give these the name of "shape".
;
; Pairs
; -----
; In order to track statistics, including the entropies and the mutual
; information, pairs consisting of a word, and the left wild-card
; ("shape") must be created. The section will not do for this purpose,
; because the section is ambiguous as to the pairing: multiple different
; word-shape pairs correspond to a single section.  Basically, if a
; connector sequence has N connectors in it, there are N shapes, and
; N word-shape pairs, but only one associated section.
;
; Using the above example: the shape will be
;
;    (Shape
;       (WordNode "playing")
;       (Connector
;          (Variable "$wildcard")
;          (ConnectorDir "-"))
;       (Connector
;          (WordNode "field")
;          (ConnectorDir "+"))))
;
; and the word-shape pair will be
;
;    (CrossSection
;       (WordNode "level")
;       (Shape ... the above shape))
;
; TODO: with appropriate cleanup, this probably should be moved
; to a generic "section" or "sheaf" module.  That is because it
; generically explodes a section into all of it's constituent
; connector-shape pairs, which is presumably something everyone
; will want to do. There's nothing special about WordNodes, here.
;
; The redesign requires passing in the correct object holding the
; sections that should be shaped.

  add-shape-vec-api -- Provide API for CrossSections (word-shape pairs
  that correspond to Sections).  Assumes that LLOBJ provides an API
  that gives access to Sections.

  A CrossSection has the following form:
      (CrossSection
          germ  <-- this is a WordNode or a WordClassNode
          (Shape
             point  <-- this is a WordNode or a WordClassNode
             (ConnectorLink ...)
             (ConnectorLink ...)
             ...))

  A more detailed description is given in the `shape-vec.scm` file.

  In addition to the usual methods, this class also provides a
  collection of methods that are used to merge Sections and
  CrossSections by replacing specific Words by WordClasses both
  in the germ, and in the Connectors.  These are described below.

  'make-section CROSS  -- Create and return the section that corresponds
       to the CrossSection CROSS.

  'get-section CROSS  -- Return the section that corresponds to the
       CrossSection CROSS, if it exists.

  'get-cross-sections SECT -- Return all of the CrossSections that
       cover the Section SECT. This returns only those cross-sections
       that are already in the AtomSpace; it does not create them.

  'explode-sections -- create all possible CrossSections that correspond
       to existing Sections (on LLOBJ).  The count on each cross-section
       will be set to the count on the section. (This is the correct
       way to handle counts, if one wants clustering to commute with
       the creation of sections.)

  'implode-sections -- remove CrossSections so that they no longer appear
       in the basis.

  'make-flat CLS PNT -- Rewrite PNT, replacing occurances of any atoms
       belonging to CLS by CLS.

  'flatten CLS PNT -- Rewrite PNT, replacing occurances of any atoms
       belonging to CLS by CLS.  If PNT is already flat, (i.e. if there
       is nothing to be rewritten), then return #f. This just calls
       one of the two methods below, basecd on the type of PNT.

  'flatten-section CLS SECT -- Rewrite SECT, replacing the germ by CLS,
       and also any connectors that belong to CLS by the corresponding
       connector for CLS. If no connectors belong to CLS, then return #f.

  'flatten-cross CLS CROSS -- Rewrite CROSS, replacing the germ by CLS.
       If the 'point' belong to CLS, it is replaced by CLS. If any
       connectors belong to CLS, they are replaced by the corresponding
       connector for CLS. If neither the point, nor the connectors belong
       to CLS, then return #f.

  add-covering-sections LLOBJ -- Direct sum of Sections and CrossSections

  This object accepts an LLOBJ that exposes vectors of Sections, and
  provides an API for vectors of Sections-oplus-CrossSections, i.e. for
  the direct sum of these two.  Thus, any given vector will have basis
  elements taken from both. The CrossSections are provided by the
  `add-shape-vec-api` object.

  This is done in order to get a self-consistent view into the
  (word,disjunct) pair matrix, when words are being clustered into
  clusters. The issue is that words appear not only on the left, but
  also within Connectors in the disjunct. During clustering, the
  Connectors need to be merged, and the disjuncts updated. The
  CrossSections provide an \"almost-linear\" API that helps perform
  this task. That is, merging is inherently non-linear, and, in some
  cases, non-cummutative. The CrossSections and Shapes help keep things
  almost linear as far into the process as possible.

  Since the whole point of this object is to support merging, it will
  wrap the LLOBJ with the `add-gram-class-api` object.

  See docs for `add-shape-vec-api` for more info about CrossSections
  and Shapes. See `direct-sum` for more info about the direct sum.
  See `add-gram-class-api` for more about grammatical classes.
