; OVERVIEW
; --------
; See `gram-classification.scm` and `gram-projective.scm` for an overview.
;
; Given N vectors that have been selected to form a cluster, one can
; determine what basis elements should be a part of that cluster by
; looking to see what all the vectors have in common. If the majority
; of the vectors share a particular basis element, then all of them
; should contribute that element to the cluster.
;
; This is termed "democratic voting" since a majority concept is used,
; and each vector gets one vote. (Future extensions might consider
; proportional votes?) This idea really only works if N>2 as voting
; between two contributors does not make really make sense.
;
; TODO:
; * Reintroduce FRAC for those disjuncts not shared by the majority.
;   Overall seems like a bad idea, but the unit tests do test it.
;   (i.e. its needed to replace `make-merge-pair` code with this code.
;
; make-merge-majority
; -------------------
; Merge N items into a brand new cluster.  See also `make-merge-pair`
; (not in this file) which merges two items at a time, possibly into
; existing clusters.

; TODO: we can very easily re-introduce FRAC here, and thus
; provide compatibility with the older merge methods. Just
; modify `clique` below to do this.

  count-shared-conseq LLOBJ QUORUM NOISE WORD-LIST -- Return a count
  of the number of connector sequences which are shared by a majority
  of the words in WORD-LIST. Actually, return a list of two numbers:
  this count and the total connector sequences appearing in common in
  all of the words.  Dividing these two numbers gives a generalized form
  of the Jaccard similarity between all of the words in the WORD-LIST.

  The majority is determined by QUORUM, which should be a floating-
  point number between 0.0 and 1.0.

  ConnectorSeq's with a count of less than NOISE are ignored.

  This function is a kind-of Jaccard distance between multiple words
  (two or more).  The conventional (unweighted) Jaccard distance is
  defined only for pairs of items. The generalization is done by
  counting to see if a fraction QUORUM is shared. Setting QUORUM to
  1.0, and applying the function to two items returns the conventional
  Jaccard distance.

  make-merger-majority LLOBJ QUORUM NOISE MRG-CON --
  Return a function that will merge a list of words into one class.
  The disjuncts that are selected to be merged are those shared by
  the majority of the given words, where `majority` is defined as
  a fraction that is greater or equal to QUORUM.

  LLOBJ is the object holding the disjuncts. For example, it could
  be (add-dynamic-stars (make-pseudo-cset-api))

  QUORUM is a floating point number indicating the fraction of members
  that must share a given disjunct, before that disjunct is merged into
  the cluster.

  NOISE is a count, such that if a ConnectorSeq has a count less
  than or equal to this, it will always be merged, irrespective of
  the majority vote. In short, small differences between members
  are ignored, and lumped up into the quirkness of the group.

  MRG-CON is #t if Connectors should also be merged.  This requires
  that the LLOBJ object have shapes on it.
