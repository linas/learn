; disjunct-counting pipeline. Starts the CogServer, opens the database,
; loads the word-pairs in the database (which can take an hour or more!).
;
; Before disjunct counting can be started, the pair-marginals must be
; computed, using `marginals-pair.scm`. Use the shell script
; `3-mst-parsing/compute-mst-marginals.sh` to do this.
;
; After disjunct counting has finished, but before grammatical
; clustering is started, the marginals must be computed, using either
; `marginals-mst.scm` or `marginals-mst-shape.scm`.
