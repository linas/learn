; Run everything needed to get ready to start the language-learning
; word-pair counting pipeline. Starts the CogServer, opens the
; database. Uses a gate to prevent counting until the CogServer is
; ready.
;
; After pair-counting has finished, but before disjunct counting is
; started, the pair-marginals must be computed, using
;  `marginals-pair.scm`. Use the shell script
; `3-mst-parsing/compute-mst-marginals.sh` to do this.
